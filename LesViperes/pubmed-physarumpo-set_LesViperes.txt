AB  - Recent results show that the chemotactic response of uni-cellular decentralized 
      systems such as amoeboid and mammalian cells, is excitable. The same observation has 
      not yet been reported for multi-nucleated decentralized biological systems. Here we 
      present experimental results that shows the Physarum polycephalum plasmodial nodes 
      spatio-temporal chemotactic dynamics as an excitable response. We found a highly 
      optimized signal synthesis method wherein the Physarum nodes employ two intensity 
      thresholds to properly navigate the chemoattractant field and generate corresponding 
      spike dynamics in the node count. The node spike dynamics was found to correspond to 
      the polarized-depolarized transition in the Physarum polycephalum morphology. 
      Validation of our experimental observations via Brownian lattice simulations yields 
      the same quantitative results with our experiments.

AB  - Concerns about the environmental and human health implications of TiO(2) 
      nanoparticles (nTiO(2)) are growing with their increased use in consumer and 
      industrial products. Investigations of the underlying molecular mechanisms of 
      nTiO(2) tolerance in organisms will assist in countering nTiO(2) toxicity. In this 
      study, the countermeasures exhibited by the slime mold Physarum polycephalum 
      macroplasmodium against nTiO(2) toxicity were investigated from a physiological, 
      transcriptional, and metabolic perspective. The results suggested that the 
      countermeasures against nTiO(2) exposure include gene-associated metabolic 
      rearrangements in cellular pathways involved in amino acid, carbohydrate, and 
      nucleic acid metabolism. Gene-associated nonmetabolic rearrangements involve 
      processes such as DNA repair, DNA replication, and the cell cycle, and occur mainly 
      when macroplasmodia are exposed to inhibitory doses of nTiO(2). Interestingly, the 
      growth of macroplasmodia and mammal cells was significantly restored by 
      supplementation with a combination of responsive metabolites identified by 
      metabolome analysis. Taken together, we report a novel model organism for the study 
      of nTiO(2) tolerance and provide insights into countermeasures taken by 
      macroplasmodia in response to nTiO(2) toxicity. Furthermore, we also present an 
      approach to mitigate the effects of nTiO(2) toxicity in cells by metabolic 
      intervention.

AB  - This research addresses the interactions between the unicellular slime mold Physarum 
      polycephalum and a red yeast in a spatial ecosystem over week-long imaging 
      experiments. An inverse relationship between the growth rates of both species is 
      shown, where P. polycephalum has positive growth when the red yeast has a negative 
      growth rate and vice versa. The data also captures successional and oscillatory 
      dynamics between both species. An advanced image analysis methodology for semantic 
      segmentation is used to quantify population density over time, for all components of 
      the ecosystem. We suggest that P. polycephalum is capable of exhibiting a 
      sustainable feeding strategy by depositing a nutritive slime trail, allowing yeast 
      to serve as a periodic food source. This opens a new direction of P. polycephalum 
      research, where the population dynamics of spatial ecosystems can be readily 
      quantified and complex ecological dynamics can be studied.

AB  - Histone modifications have been widely correlated with genetic activities. However, 
      how these posttranslational modifications affect the dynamics and the structure of 
      chromatin is poorly understood. Here, we describe the incorporation of the exogenous 
      histone proteins into the slime mold Physarum polycephalum, which has been revealed 
      to be a valuable tool for examining different facets of the function histones in 
      chromatin dynamics like replication-coupled chromatin assembly, histone exchange, 
      and nucleosome turnover.

TI  - Polyphorm: Structural Analysis of Cosmological Datasets via Interactive Physarum 
      Polycephalum Visualization.
PG  - 806-816
LID - 10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030407 [doi]
AB  - This paper introduces Polyphorm, an interactive visualization and model fitting tool 
      that provides a novel approach for investigating cosmological datasets. Through a 
      fast computational simulation method inspired by the behavior of Physarum 
      polycephalum, an unicellular slime mold organism that efficiently forages for 
      nutrients, astrophysicists are able to extrapolate from sparse datasets, such as 
      galaxy maps archived in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and then use these 
      extrapolations to inform analyses of a wide range of other data, such as 
      spectroscopic observations captured by the Hubble Space Telescope. Researchers can 
      interactively update the simulation by adjusting model parameters, and then 
      investigate the resulting visual output to form hypotheses about the data. We 
      describe details of Polyphorm's simulation model and its interaction and 
      visualization modalities, and we evaluate Polyphorm through three scientific use 
      cases that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

AB  - Microbial fuels cells (MFCs) are bio-electrochemical transducers that generate 
      energy from the metabolism of electro-active microorganisms. The organism Physarum 
      polycephalum is a slime mould, which has demonstrated many novel and interesting 
      properties in the field of unconventional computation, such as route mapping between 
      nutrient sources, maze solving and nutrient balancing. It is a motile, 
      photosensitive and oxygen-consuming organism, and is known to be symbiotic with 
      some, and antagonistic with other microbial species. In the context of artificial 
      life, the slime mould would provide a biological mechanism (along with the microbial 
      community) for controlling the performance and behaviour of artificial systems 
      (MFCs, robots). In the experiments it was found that P. polycephalum did not 
      generate significant amounts of power when inoculated in the anode. However, when P. 
      polycephalum was introduced in the cathode of MFCs, a statistically significant 
      difference in power output was observed.

AB  - Complex behaviors are typically associated with animals, but the capacity to 
      integrate information and function as a coordinated individual is also a ubiquitous 
      but poorly understood feature of organisms such as slime molds and fungi. Plasmodial 
      slime molds grow as networks and use flexible, undifferentiated body plans to forage 
      for food. How an individual communicates across its network remains a puzzle, but 
      Physarum polycephalum has emerged as a novel model used to explore emergent 
      dynamics. Within P. polycephalum, cytoplasm is shuttled in a peristaltic wave driven 
      by cross-sectional contractions of tubes. We first track P. polycephalum's response 
      to a localized nutrient stimulus and observe a front of increased contraction. The 
      front propagates with a velocity comparable to the flow-driven dispersion of 
      particles. We build a mathematical model based on these data and in the aggregate 
      experiments and model identify the mechanism of signal propagation across a body: 
      The nutrient stimulus triggers the release of a signaling molecule. The molecule is 
      advected by fluid flows but simultaneously hijacks flow generation by causing local 
      increases in contraction amplitude as it travels. The molecule is initiating a 
      feedback loop to enable its own movement. This mechanism explains previously 
      puzzling phenomena, including the adaptation of the peristaltic wave to organism 
      size and P. polycephalum's ability to find the shortest route between food sources. 
      A simple feedback seems to give rise to P. polycephalum's complex behaviors, and the 
      same mechanism is likely to function in the thousands of additional species with 
      similar behaviors.

AB  - Because of its peculiar biology and the ease with which it can be cultured, the 
      acellular slime mould Physarum polycephalum has long been a model organism in a 
      range of disciplines. Due to its macroscopic, syncytial nature, it is no surprise 
      that it has been a favourite amongst cell biologists. Its inclusion in the 
      experimental tool kit of behavioural ecologists is much more recent. These recent 
      studies have certainly paid off. They have shown that, for an organism that lacks a 
      brain or central nervous system, P. polycephalum shows rather complex behaviour. For 
      example, it is capable of finding the shortest path through a maze, it can construct 
      networks as efficient as those designed by humans, it can solve computationally 
      difficult puzzles, it makes multi-objective foraging decisions, it balances its 
      nutrient intake and it even behaves irrationally. Are the slime mould's achievements 
      simply "cute", worthy of mentioning in passing but nothing to take too seriously? Or 
      do they hint at the fundamental processes underlying all decision making? We will 
      address this question after reviewing the decision-making abilities of the slime 
      mould.

TI  - Cytotoxicity activities and chemical characteristics of exopolysaccharides and 
      intracellular polysaccharides of Physarum polycephalum microplasmodia.

LID - 28
AB  - BACKGROUND: Microbial polysaccharides have been reported to possess remarkable 
      bioactivities. Physarum polycephalum is a species of slime mold for which the 
      microplasmodia are capable of rapid growth and can produce a significant amount of 
      cell wall-less biomass. There has been a limited understanding of the 
      polysaccharides produced by microplasmodia of slime molds, including P. 
      polycephalum. Thus, the primary objectives of this research were first to chemically 
      characterize the exopolysaccharides (EPS) and intracellular polysaccharides (IPS) of 
      P. polycephalum microplasmodia and then to evaluate their cytotoxicity against 
      several cancer cell lines. RESULTS: The yields of the crude EPS (4.43 ± 0.44 g/l) 
      and partially purified (deproteinated) EPS (2.95 ± 0.85 g/l) were comparable 
      (p > 0.05) with the respective crude IPS (3.46 ± 0.36 g/l) and partially purified 
      IPS (2.45 ± 0.36 g/l). The average molecular weight of the EPS and IPS were 
      14,762 kDa and 1788 kDa. The major monomer of the EPS was galactose (80.22%), while 
      that of the IPS was glucose (84.46%). Both crude and purified IPS samples showed 
      significantly higher cytotoxicity toward Hela cells, especially the purified sample 
      and none of the IPSs inhibited normal cells. Only 38.42 ± 2.84% Hela cells remained 
      viable when treated with the partially purified IPS (1 mg/ml). However, although 
      only 34.76 ± 6.58% MCF-7 cells were viable when exposed to the crude IPS, but the 
      partially purified IPS displayed non-toxicity to MCF-7 cells. This suggested that 
      the cytotoxicity toward MCF-7 would come from some component associated with the 
      crude IPS sample (e.g. proteins, peptides or ion metals) and the purification 
      process would have either completely removed or reduced amount of that component. 
      Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry suggested that the mechanism of the toxicity 
      of the crude IPS toward MCF-7 and the partially purified IPS toward Hela cells was 
      due to apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: The EPS and IPS of P. polycephalum microplasmodia had 
      different chemical properties including carbohydrate, protein and total sulfate 
      group contents, monosaccharide composition and molecular weights, which led to 
      different cytotoxicity activities. The crude and partially purified IPSs would be 
      potential materials for further study relating to cancer treatment.

AB  - Spliceosomal introns interrupt nuclear genes and are removed from RNA transcripts 
      ("spliced") by machinery called spliceosomes. Although the vast majority of 
      spliceosomal introns are removed by the so-called major (or "U2") spliceosome, 
      diverse eukaryotes also contain a rare second form, the minor ("U12") spliceosome, 
      and associated ("U12-type") introns.(1-3) In all characterized species, U12-type 
      introns are distinguished by several features, including being rare in the genome 
      (∼0.5% of all introns),(4-6) containing extended evolutionarily conserved splicing 
      motifs,(4)(,)(5)(,)(7)(,)(8) being generally ancient,(9)(,)(10) and being 
      inefficiently spliced.(11-13) Here, we report a remarkable exception in the slime 
      mold Physarum polycephalum. The P. polycephalum genome contains >20,000 U12-type 
      introns-25 times more than any other species-enriched in a diversity of 
      non-canonical splice boundaries as well as transformed splicing signals that appear 
      to have co-evolved with the spliceosome due to massive gain of efficiently spliced 
      U12-type introns. These results reveal an unappreciated dynamism of minor 
      spliceosomal introns and spliceosomal introns in general.

TI  - Calcium regulation of the actin-myosin interaction of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 53-98
AB  - Plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum show vigorous cytoplasmic streaming, the motive 
      force of which is supported by the actin-myosin interaction. Calcium is not required 
      for the interaction but inhibits it. This calcium inhibition, a regulatory mode 
      first discovered in Physarum, is the overwhelming mode of regulation of cytoplasmic 
      streaming of plant cells and lower eukaryotes, and it is diametrically opposite to 
      calcium activation of the interaction found in muscle and nonmuscle cells of the 
      animal kingdom. Myosin, myosin II in myosin superfamily, is the most important 
      protein for Ca2+ action. Its essential light chain, called calcium-binding light 
      chain, is the sole protein that binds Ca2+. Although phosphorylation and 
      dephosphorylation of myosin modify its properties, regulation of physiological 
      significance is shown to be Ca-binding to myosin. The actin-binding protein of 
      Physarum amplifies calcium inhibition when Ca2+ binds to calmodulin and other 
      calcium-binding proteins. This review also includes characterization of this and 
      other calcium-binding proteins of Physarum.

AB  - Brain glioma treatment with checkpoint inhibitor antibodies to cytotoxic 
      T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (a-CTLA-4) and programmed cell death-1 (a-PD-1) 
      was largely unsuccessful due to their inability to cross blood-brain barrier (BBB). 
      Here we describe targeted nanoscale immunoconjugates (NICs) on natural biopolymer 
      scaffold, poly(β-L-malic acid), with covalently attached a-CTLA-4 or a-PD-1 for 
      systemic delivery across the BBB and activation of local brain anti-tumor immune 
      response. NIC treatment of mice bearing intracranial GL261 glioblastoma (GBM) 
      results in an increase of CD8+ T cells, NK cells and macrophages with a decrease of 
      regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the brain tumor area. Survival of GBM-bearing mice 
      treated with NIC combination is significantly longer compared to animals treated 
      with single checkpoint inhibitor-bearing NICs or free a-CTLA-4 and a-PD-1. Our study 
      demonstrates trans-BBB delivery of tumor-targeted polymer-conjugated checkpoint 
      inhibitors as an effective GBM treatment via activation of both systemic and local 
      privileged brain tumor immune response.

AB  - Glucose deprivation in the slime mold Physarum polycephalum leads to a specific 
      morphotype, a highly motile mesoplasmodium. We investigated the ultrastructure of 
      both mesoplasmodia and non-starved plasmodia and found significantly increased 
      numbers of mitochondria in glucose-deprived mesoplasmodia. The volume of individual 
      mitochondria was the same in both growth forms. We conjecture that the number of 
      mitochondria correlates with the metabolic state of the cell: When glucose is 
      absent, the slime mold is forced to switch to different metabolic pathways, which 
      occur inside mitochondria. Furthermore, a catabolic cue (such as AMP-activated 
      protein kinase (AMPK)) could stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis.

PG  - e28543

LID - e28543
AB  - In previous work the chemotaxis toward simple organic chemicals was assessed. We 
      utilize the knowledge gained from these chemotactic assays to route Physarum 
      polycephalum "signals" at a series of junctions. By applying chemical inputs at a 
      simple T-junction we were able to reproducibly control the path taken by the 
      plasmodium of P. Polycephalum. Where the chemoattractant farnesene was used at one 
      input a routed signal could be reproducibly generated i.e., P. Polycephalum moves 
      toward the source of chemoattractant. Where the chemoattractant was applied at both 
      inputs the signal was reproducibly split i.e., at the junction the plasmodium splits 
      and moves toward both sources of chemoattractant. If a chemorepellent was used then 
      the signal was reproducibly suppressed i.e., P. Polycephalum did not reach either 
      output and was confined to the input channel. This was regardless of whether a 
      chemoattractant was used in combination with the chemorepellent showing a hierarchy 
      of inhibition over attraction. If no chemical input was used in the simple circuit 
      then a random signal was generated, whereby P. Polycephalum would move toward one 
      output at the junction, but the direction was randomly selected.

TI  - Maternal inheritance of mitochondria: multipolarity, multiallelism and hierarchical 
      transmission of mitochondrial DNA in the true slime mold Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 139-48
LID - 10.1007/s10265-009-0298-5 [doi]
AB  - Direct evidence of digestion of paternal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been found in 
      the true slime mold Physarum polycephalum. This is the first report on the selective 
      digestion of mtDNA inside the zygote, and is striking evidence for the mechanism of 
      maternal inheritance of mitochondria. Moreover, two mitochondrial nuclease 
      activities were detected in this organism as-candidates for the nucleases 
      responsible for selective digestion of mtDNA. In the true slime mold, there is an 
      additional-feature of the uniparental inheritance of mitochondria.Although 
      mitochondria are believed to be inherited from the maternal lineage in nearly all 
      eukaryotes, the mating types of the true slime mold P. polycephalum is not 
      restricted to two: there are three mating loci--matA, matB,and matC--and these loci 
      have 16, 15, and 3 alleles,-respectively. Interestingly, the transmission patterns 
      of mtDNA are determined by the matA locus, in a hierarchical-fashion (matA 
      hierarchy) as follows: matA7[matA2[matA11[matA12[matA15/matA16[matA1[matA6.The 
      strain possessing the higher status of matA would be the mtDNA donor in crosses. 
      Furthermore, we have found that some crosses showed biparental inheritance of 
      mitochondria.This review describes the phenomenon of hierarchical transmission of 
      mtDNA in true slime molds, and discusses the presumed molecular mechanism of 
      maternal and biparental inheritance.

PG  - 078103
AB  - We study the formation of transportation networks of the true slime mold Physarum 
      polycephalum after fragmentation by shear. Small fragments, called microplasmodia, 
      fuse to form macroplasmodia in a percolation transition. At this topological phase 
      transition, one single giant component forms, connecting most of the previously 
      isolated microplasmodia. Employing the configuration model of graph theory for small 
      link degree, we have found analytically an exact solution for the phase transition. 
      It is generally applicable to percolation as seen, e.g., in vascular networks.

TI  - Effects of medium composition on the growth and lipid production of microplasmodia 
      of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - e2873
LID - 10.1002/btpr.2873 [doi]
AB  - Physarum polycephalum is a plasmodial slime mold. One of the trophic stages in the 
      life cycle of this organism is a plasmodium. In submerged culture, plasmodia are 
      fragmented into microplasmodia. The latter both lack cell walls and are capable of 
      rapid growth. There has been limited information on the effects of medium 
      composition on the growth and lipid accumulation of microplasmodia. In this study, 
      optimization of medium components by response surface methodology showed that 
      tryptone and yeast extract concentrations had the most significant effects on lipid 
      and biomass production; significant synergistic interactions between glucose and 
      tryptone concentration on these responses were also recorded. The optimal medium was 
      composed of 20 g/L of glucose, 6.59 g/L of tryptone, and 3.0 g/L of yeast extract. 
      This medium yielded 13.86 g/L of dry biomass and 1.97 g/L of lipids. These amounts 
      are threefold higher than those of the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 
      medium. In addition, biomass and lipid production reached maximal values between 
      only 4 and 5 days. Fatty acid compositions analysis by gas chromatography-mass 
      spectrometer (GC-MS) revealed that P. polycephalum lipids consisted mainly of oleic 
      acid (40.5%), linoleic acid (10%), and octadecynoic (15.8%). This is the first 
      report on the fatty acid composition of P. polycephalum microplasmodia. These 
      results suggest that the biomass of microplasmodia could be used as a source of 
      material for direct conversion into biodiesel because of the absence of cell walls 
      or it could also be used as a supplemental source of beneficial fatty acids for 
      humans, albeit with some further evaluation needed.

TI  - Pruning to Increase Taylor Dispersion in Physarum polycephalum Networks.
PG  - 178103
AB  - How do the topology and geometry of a tubular network affect the spread of particles 
      within fluid flows? We investigate patterns of effective dispersion in the 
      hierarchical, biological transport network formed by Physarum polycephalum. We 
      demonstrate that a change in topology-pruning in the foraging state-causes a large 
      increase in effective dispersion throughout the network. By comparison, changes in 
      the hierarchy of tube radii result in smaller and more localized differences. Pruned 
      networks capitalize on Taylor dispersion to increase the dispersion capability.

LID - 10.1186/1471-2164-9-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Physarum polycephalum, an acellular plasmodial species belongs to the 
      amoebozoa, a major branch in eukaryote evolution. Its complex life cycle and rich 
      cell biology is reflected in more than 2500 publications on various aspects of its 
      biochemistry, developmental biology, cytoskeleton, and cell motility. It now can be 
      genetically manipulated, opening up the possibility of targeted functional analysis 
      in this organism. METHODS: Here we describe a large fraction of the transcribed 
      genes by sequencing a cDNA library from the plasmodial stage of the developmental 
      cycle. RESULTS: In addition to the genes for the basic metabolism we found an 
      unexpected large number of genes involved in sophisticated signaling networks and 
      identified potential receptors for environmental signals such as light. In 
      accordance with the various developmental options of the plasmodial cell we found 
      that many P. polycephalum genes are alternatively spliced. Using 30 donor and 30 
      acceptor sites we determined the splicing signatures of this species. Comparisons to 
      various other organisms including Dictyostelium, the closest relative, revealed that 
      roughly half of the transcribed genes have no detectable counterpart, thus 
      potentially defining species specific adaptations. On the other hand, we found 
      highly conserved proteins, which are maintained in the metazoan lineage, but absent 
      in D. discoideum or plants. These genes arose possibly in the last common ancestor 
      of Amoebozoa and Metazoa but were lost in D. discoideum. CONCLUSION: This work 
      provides an analysis of up to half of the protein coding genes of Physarum 
      polycephalum. The definition of splice motifs together with the description of 
      alternatively spliced genes will provide a valuable resource for the ongoing genome 
      project.

AB  - Plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum is a single cell visible by unaided eye. The 
      plasmodium's foraging behaviour is interpreted in terms of computation. Input data 
      is a configuration of nutrients, result of computation is a network of plasmodium's 
      cytoplasmic tubes spanning sources of nutrients. Tsuda et al. (2004) experimentally 
      demonstrated that basic logical gates can be implemented in foraging behaviour of 
      the plasmodium. We simplify the original designs of the gates and show - in computer 
      models - that the plasmodium is capable for computation of two-input two-output gate 
      x, y-->xy, x+y and three-input two-output x,y,z-->x yz,x+y+z. We assemble the gates 
      in a binary one-bit adder and demonstrate validity of the design using computer 
      simulation.

AB  - The slime mould Physarum polycephalum is a large single celled myxomycete; its 
      plasmodium consists of tubes which extend to find sources of food. It has been 
      previously shown that the tubes are conductive with a resistance of approximately 3 
      MΩ, and have been used in basic DC circuits. Hybrid slime mould-electronic circuits 
      have been proposed, using the protoplasmic tubes, grown between agar, as Physarum 
      wires. This paper aims to evaluate the electrical properties of the protoplasmic 
      tubes with respect to analogue and digital waveforms. The Physarum wires act as low 
      pass filters with a mean cut off frequency of 19kHz (SD 9 KHz); they have a 12.1 
      dB/decade roll-off (SD 1.9 dB/decade). Mean attenuation across the band-pass range 
      is -6 dB (S.D. 4.5 dB). The mechanism for the frequency dependant attenuation is 
      unknown however a combination of protoplasmic electrolyte and the cytoskeletal 
      structure is the most likely cause. The tubes last approximately 2 weeks before 
      forming a dry sclerotia, when they cease being conductive and is the prevalent 
      limiting factor of their practical use; this is caused by dehydration and lack of 
      nutrition, a limitation which may be overcome. The potential for Physarum wires in 
      hybrid circuits is strengthened; while previous circuits were simple DC circuits, 
      this work demonstrates that they may be used as electronic components or wires in 
      both digital and analogue circuits or even as a computing component in analogue 
      computers.

AB  - Shortest path is among classical problems of computer science. The problems are 
      solved by hundreds of algorithms, silicon computing architectures and novel 
      substrate, unconventional, computing devices. Acellular slime mould P. polycephalum 
      is originally famous as a computing biological substrate due to its alleged ability 
      to approximate shortest path from its inoculation site to a source of nutrients. 
      Several algorithms were designed based on properties of the slime mould. Many of the 
      Physarum-inspired algorithms suffer from a low converge speed. To accelerate the 
      search of a solution and reduce a number of iterations we combined an original model 
      of Physarum-inspired path solver with a new a parameter, called energy. We undertook 
      a series of computational experiments on approximating shortest paths in networks 
      with different topologies, and number of nodes varying from 15 to 2000. We found 
      that the improved Physarum algorithm matches well with existing Physarum-inspired 
      approaches yet outperforms them in number of iterations executed and a total running 
      time. We also compare our algorithm with other existing algorithms, including the 
      ant colony optimization algorithm and Dijkstra algorithm.

AB  - Plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum is a single cell with many nuclei. Plasmodium is 
      an easy-to-experiment-with biological substrate, a multi-functional bio-material 
      used to implement novel and future computing architectures. The plasmodium exhibits 
      typical features of excitable chemical systems and capable for distributed sensing, 
      parallel information processing and decentralized actuation. Plasmodium of P. 
      polycephalum is proved to be a universal storage modification machine. Actively 
      growing zones of the plasmodium are considered to be elementary processors of the 
      growing computing machine, as well as messages traveling in the spatially extended 
      non-linear medium. Controlling propagation of the messages and computing processes 
      is a prerequisite for a successful implementation of working prototypes of 
      plasmodium machines. In laboratory experiments and computer simulation we show that 
      active growing zones of plasmodium can be precisely routed using repelling diffusion 
      gradients generated by crystals of sodium chloride. We demonstrate how to achieve 
      controllable reflection, splitting/multiplication and merging of plasmodium's active 
      zones.

AB  - Slime mold Physarum polycephalum is a single cell visible by an unaided eye. The 
      slime mold optimizes its network of protoplasmic tubes to minimize expose to 
      repellents and maximize expose to attractants and to make efficient transportation 
      of nutrients. These properties of P. polycephalum, together with simplicity of its 
      handling and culturing, make it a priceless substrate for designing novel sensing, 
      computing and actuating architectures in living amorphous biological substrate. We 
      demonstrate that, by loading Physarum with magnetic particles and positioning it in 
      a magnetic field, we can, in principle, impose analog control procedures to 
      precisely route active growing zones of slime mold and shape topology of its 
      protoplasmic networks.

AB  - Physarum polycephalum, a single-celled, multinucleate slime mould, is a seemingly 
      simple organism, yet it exhibits quasi-intelligent behaviour during extension, 
      foraging, and as it adapts to dynamic environments. For these reasons, Physarum is 
      an attractive target for modelling with the underlying goal to uncover the 
      physiological mechanisms behind the exhibited quasi-intelligence and/or to devise 
      novel algorithms for solving complex computational problems. The recent increase in 
      modelling studies on Physarum has prompted us to review the latest developments in 
      this field in the context of modelling and computing alike. Specifically, we cover 
      models based on (i) morphology, (ii) taxis, and (iii) positive feedback dynamics 
      found in top-down and bottom-up modelling techniques. We also survey the application 
      of each of these core features of Physarum to solving difficult computational 
      problems with real-world applications. Finally, we highlight some open problems in 
      the field and present directions for future research.

TI  - Physarum polycephalum mutants in the photocontrol of sporulation display altered 
      patterns in the correlated expression of developmentally regulated genes.
PG  - 247-59
LID - 10.1111/dgd.12029 [doi]
AB  - Physarum polycephalum is a lower eukaryote belonging to the amoebozoa group of 
      organisms that forms macroscopic, multinucleate plasmodial cells during its 
      developmental cycle. Plasmodia can exit proliferative growth and differentiate by 
      forming fruiting bodies containing mononucleate, haploid spores. This process, 
      called sporulation, is controlled by starvation and visible light. To genetically 
      dissect the regulatory control of the commitment to sporulation, we have isolated 
      plasmodial mutants that are altered in the photocontrol of sporulation in a 
      phenotypic screen of N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenized cells. Several 
      non-sporulating mutants were analyzed by measuring the light-induced change in the 
      expression pattern of a set of 35 genes using GeXP multiplex reverse 
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction with RNA isolated from individual plasmodial 
      cells. Mutants showed altered patterns of differentially regulated genes in response 
      to light stimulation. Some genes clearly displayed pairwise correlation in terms of 
      their expression level as measured in individual plasmodial cells. The pattern of 
      pairwise correlation differed in various mutants, suggesting that different upstream 
      regulators were disabled in the different mutants. We propose that patterns of 
      pairwise correlation in gene expression might be useful to infer the underlying gene 
      regulatory network.

AB  - The plasmodial slime mold Physarum polycephalum exhibits strong, periodic flow of 
      cytoplasm through the veins of its network. In the special case of mesoplasmodia, a 
      newly described starvation-induced, shape-constant morphotype, this periodic 
      endoplasm streaming is the basis of locomotion. Furthermore, we presume that 
      cytoplasm flow is also involved in signal transmission and signal processing. 
      Mesoplasmodia motility resembles amoeboid locomotion. In contrast to other amoebae, 
      however, mesoplasmodia move without extending pseudopods and retain a coherent, 
      fan-shaped morphology throughout their steady locomotion. Attaining sizes of up to 2 
      mm2, mesoplasmodia are also much bigger than other amoebae. We characterize this 
      particular type of locomotion and identify patterns of movement. By using the 
      analogy between pulsatile fluid flow through a network of elastic tubes and 
      electrical circuits, we build a lumped model that explains observed fluid flow 
      patterns. Essentially, the mesoplasmodium acts as a low-pass filter, permitting only 
      low-frequency oscillations to propagate from back to front. This frequency selection 
      serves to optimize flow and reduces power dissipation. Furthermore, we introduce a 
      distributed element into the lumped model to explain cell polarization during the 
      onset of chemotaxis: Biochemical cues (internal or external) lead to a local 
      softening of the actin cortex, which in turn causes an increased flow of cytoplasm 
      into that area and, thus, a net forward movement. We conclude that the internal 
      actin-enclosed vein network gives the slime mold a high measure of control over 
      fluid transport, especially by softening or hardening, which in turn leads to 
      polarization and net movement.

AB  - An amoeboid unicellular organism, a plasmodium of the true slime mold Physarum 
      polycephalum, exhibits complex spatiotemporal oscillatory dynamics and sophisticated 
      information processing capabilities while deforming its amorphous body. We 
      previously devised an 'amoeba-based computer (ABC),' that implemented optical 
      feedback control to lead this amoeboid organism to search for a solution to the 
      traveling salesman problem (TSP). In the ABC, the shortest TSP route (the optimal 
      solution) is represented by the shape of the organism in which the body area 
      (nutrient absorption) is maximized while the risk of being exposed to aversive light 
      stimuli is minimized. The shortness of the TSP route found by ABC, therefore, serves 
      as a quantitative measure of the optimality of the decision made by the organism. 
      However, it remains unclear how the decision-making ability of the organism 
      originates from the oscillatory dynamics of the organism. We investigated the number 
      of coexisting traveling waves in the spatiotemporal patterns of the oscillatory 
      dynamics of the organism. We show that a shorter TSP route can be found when the 
      organism exhibits a lower number of traveling waves. The results imply that the 
      oscillatory dynamics are highly coordinated throughout the global body. Based on the 
      results, we discuss the fact that the decision-making ability of the organism can be 
      enhanced not by uncorrelated random fluctuations, but by its highly coordinated 
      oscillatory dynamics.

AB  - Physarum polycephalum is a slime mold that is apparently able to solve shortest path 
      problems. A mathematical model has been proposed by Tero et al. (Journal of 
      Theoretical Biology, 244, 2007, pp. 553-564) to describe the feedback mechanism used 
      by the slime mold to adapt its tubular channels while foraging two food sources s(0) 
      and s(1). We prove that, under this model, the mass of the mold will eventually 
      converge to the shortest s(0)-s(1) path of the network that the mold lies on, 
      independently of the structure of the network or of the initial mass distribution. 
      This matches the experimental observations by Tero et al. and can be seen as an 
      example of a "natural algorithm", that is, an algorithm developed by evolution over 
      millions of years.

AB  - A dynamic self-organized morphology is the hallmark of network-shaped organisms like 
      slime moulds and fungi. Organisms continuously reorganize their flexible, 
      undifferentiated body plans to forage for food. Among these organisms the slime 
      mould Physarum polycephalum has emerged as a model to investigate how an organism 
      can self-organize their extensive networks and act as a coordinated whole. 
      Cytoplasmic fluid flows flowing through the tubular networks have been identified as 
      the key driver of morphological dynamics. Inquiring how fluid flows can shape living 
      matter from small to large scales opens up many new avenues for research. This 
      article is part of the theme issue 'Self-organization in cell biology'.

LID - 10.1111/dgd.12384 [doi]
AB  - Vein networks span the whole body of the amoeboid organism in the plasmodial slime 
      mould Physarum polycephalum, and the network topology is rearranged within an hour 
      in response to spatio-temporal variations of the environment. It has been reported 
      that this tube morphogenesis is capable of solving mazes, and a mathematical model, 
      named the 'current reinforcement rule', was proposed based on the adaptability of 
      the veins. Although it is known that this model works well for reproducing some key 
      characters of the organism's maze-solving behaviour, one important issue is still 
      open: In the real organism, the thick veins tend to trace the shortest possible 
      route by cutting the corners at the turn of corridors, following a center-in-center 
      trajectory, but it has not yet been examined whether this feature also appears in 
      the mathematical model, using corridors of finite width. In this report, we confirm 
      that the mathematical model reproduces the center-in-center trajectory of veins 
      around corners observed in the maze-solving experiment.

AB  - The features of spectrophotometric scanner, generally exploited in the artwork 
      field, are here considered in a non-conventional context to characterize the 
      networks created by Physarum polycephalum slime mold during its motion on glass 
      substrates covered with polyaniline: a polymer that varies its color and conductive 
      properties according to the redox state. The used technique allowed the 
      investigation of the effects coming out from the interaction between P. polycephalum 
      and polyaniline. Thus, the contactless method of the analysis of polyaniline 
      conductivity state resulted from the slime mold metabolism was suggested. Indeed, it 
      is here demonstrated that P. polycephalum can modify properties of polyaniline due 
      to its internal activity in contact zones.

AB  - Networks of protoplasmic tubes of organism Physarum polycehpalum are macro-scale 
      structures which optimally span multiple food sources to avoid repellents yet 
      maximize coverage of attractants. When data are presented by configurations of 
      attractants and behaviour of the slime mould is tuned by a range of repellents, the 
      organism preforms computation. It maps given data configuration into a protoplasmic 
      network. To discover physical means of programming the slime mould computers we 
      explore conductivity of the protoplasmic tubes; proposing that the network 
      connectivity of protoplasmic tubes shows pathway-dependent plasticity. To 
      demonstrate this we encourage the slime mould to span a grid of electrodes and apply 
      AC stimuli to the network. Learning and weighted connections within a grid of 
      electrodes is produced using negative and positive voltage stimulation of the 
      network at desired nodes; low frequency (10 Hz) sinusoidal (0.5 V peak-to-peak) 
      voltage increases connectivity between stimulated electrodes while decreasing 
      connectivity elsewhere, high frequency (1000 Hz) sinusoidal (2.5 V peak-to-peak) 
      voltage stimulation decreases network connectivity between stimulated electrodes. We 
      corroborate in a particle model. This phenomenon may be used for computation in the 
      same way that neural networks process information and has the potential to shed 
      light on the dynamics of learning and information processing in non-neural metazoan 
      somatic cell networks.

AB  - Surface electrical potential and observational growth recordings were made of a 
      protoplasmic tube of the slime mould Physarum polycephalum in response to a 
      multitude of stimuli with regards to sensory fusion or multisensory integration. 
      Each stimulus was tested alone and in combination in order to evaluate for the first 
      time the effect that multiple stimuli have on the frequency of streaming 
      oscillation. White light caused a decrease in frequency whilst increasing the 
      temperature and applying a food source in the form of oat flakes both increased the 
      frequency. Simultaneously stimulating P. polycephalum with light and oat flake 
      produced no net change in frequency, while combined light and heat stimuli showed an 
      increase in frequency smaller than that observed for heat alone. When the two 
      positive stimuli, oat flakes and heat, were combined, there was a net increase in 
      frequency similar to the cumulative increases caused by the individual stimuli. 
      Boolean logic gates were derived from the measured frequency change.

TI  - Periodic traction in migrating large amoeba of Physarum polycephalum.

LID - 20150099
AB  - The slime mould Physarum polycephalum is a giant multinucleated cell exhibiting 
      well-known Ca(2+)-dependent actomyosin contractions of its vein network driving the 
      so-called cytoplasmic shuttle streaming. Its actomyosin network forms both a 
      filamentous cortical layer and large fibrils. In order to understand the role of 
      each structure in the locomotory activity, we performed birefringence observations 
      and traction force microscopy on excised fragments of Physarum. After several hours, 
      these microplasmodia adopt three main morphologies: flat motile amoeba, chain types 
      with round contractile heads connected by tubes and motile hybrid types. Each type 
      exhibits oscillations with a period of about 1.5 min of cell area, traction forces 
      and fibril activity (retardance) when fibrils are present. The amoeboid types show 
      only peripheral forces while the chain types present a never-reported force pattern 
      with contractile rings far from the cell boundary under the spherical heads. Forces 
      are mostly transmitted where the actomyosin cortical layer anchors to the 
      substratum, but fibrils maintain highly invaginated structures and contribute to 
      forces by increasing the length of the anchorage line. Microplasmodia are motile 
      only when there is an asymmetry in the shape and/or the force distribution.

AB  - The regeneration process of contractile oscillation in the plasmodium of Physarum 
      polycephalum is investigated experimentally and modelled computationally. When 
      placed in a well, the Physarum cell restructures the body (fusion of small 
      granule-like cells) and shows various complex oscillation patterns. After it 
      completed the restructuring and regained synchronized oscillation within the body, 
      the cell shows bilateral oscillation or rotating wave pattern. This regeneration 
      process did not depend on the well size and all the cases tested here showed similar 
      time course. Phase synchronization analysis based on Hilbert Transform also 
      suggested that the cell can develop a fully synchronized oscillation within a fixed 
      time no matter what the cell size is. A particle-based computational model was 
      developed in order to model the emergence of oscillation patterns. Particles 
      employing very simple and identical sensory and motor behaviors interacted with each 
      other via the sensing and deposition of chemoattractants in a diffusive environment. 
      From a random and almost homogeneous distribution, emergent domains of oscillatory 
      activity emerged. By increasing the sensory radius the model simulated the 
      regeneration process of the real plasmodium. In addition, the model replicated the 
      rotating wave and bilateral oscillation pattern when the sensory radius was 
      increased. The results suggest that complex emergent oscillatory behaviors (and thus 
      the high-level systems which may utilize them, such as pumping and transport 
      mechanisms) may be developed from simple materials inspired by Physarum slime mold.

TI  - The role of noise in self-organized decision making by the true slime mold Physarum 
      polycephalum.

LID - e0172933
AB  - Self-organized mechanisms are frequently encountered in nature and known to achieve 
      flexible, adaptive control and decision-making. Noise plays a crucial role in such 
      systems: It can enable a self-organized system to reliably adapt to short-term 
      changes in the environment while maintaining a generally stable behavior. This is 
      fundamental in biological systems because they must strike a delicate balance 
      between stable and flexible behavior. In the present paper we analyse the role of 
      noise in the decision-making of the true slime mold Physarum polycephalum, an 
      important model species for the investigation of computational abilities in simple 
      organisms. We propose a simple biological experiment to investigate the reaction of 
      P. polycephalum to time-variant risk factors and present a stochastic extension of 
      an established mathematical model for P. polycephalum to analyze this experiment. It 
      predicts that-due to the mechanism of stochastic resonance-noise can enable P. 
      polycephalum to correctly assess time-variant risk factors, while the corresponding 
      noise-free system fails to do so. Beyond the study of P. polycephalum we demonstrate 
      that the influence of noise on self-organized decision-making is not tied to a 
      specific organism. Rather it is a general property of the underlying process 
      dynamics, which appears to be universal across a wide range of systems. Our study 
      thus provides further evidence that stochastic resonance is a fundamental component 
      of the decision-making in self-organized macroscopic and microscopic groups and 
      organisms.

AB  - The plasmodium of the slime mould Physarum polycephalum forms a transportation 
      network of veins, in which protoplasm is transported due to peristaltic pumping. 
      This network forms a planar, weighted, undirected graph that, for the first time, 
      can be extracted automatically from photographs or movies. Thus, data from real 
      transportation networks have now become available for the investigation of network 
      properties. We determine the local drag of the vein segments and use these data to 
      calculate the transport efficiency. We unravel which veins form the backbone of the 
      transportation network by using a centrality measure from graph theory. The 
      principal vein segments lie on relatively ample cycles of veins, and the most 
      important segments are those that belong simultaneously to two of these principal 
      cycles. Each principal cycle contains a series of smaller cycles of veins of lower 
      transport efficiency, thus reflecting the hierarchical and self-similar structure of 
      the transportation network. Finally, we calculate accessibility maps that show how 
      easily different nodes of the network may be reached from a given reference node.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The myxomycete Physarum polycephalum appears to have remarkable 
      potential as a lipid source for biodiesel production. The present study evaluated 
      the use of rice bran as a carbon source and determined the medium components for 
      optimum growth and lipid production for this organism. RESULTS: Optimization of 
      medium components by response surface methodology showed that rice bran and yeast 
      extract had significant influences on lipid and biomass production. The optimum 
      medium consisted of 37.5 g/L rice bran, 0.79 g/L yeast extract and 12.5 g/L agar, 
      and this yielded 7.5 g/L dry biomass and 0.9 g/L lipid after 5 days. The biomass and 
      lipid production profiles revealed that these parameters increased over time and 
      reached their maximum values (10.5 and 1.26 g/L, respectively) after 7 days. 
      Physarum polycephalum growth decreased on the spent medium but using the latter 
      increased total biomass and lipid concentrations to 14.3 and 1.72 g/L, respectively. 
      CONCLUSIONS: An effective method for inoculum preparation was developed for biomass 
      and lipid production by P. polycephalum on a low-cost medium using rice bran as the 
      main carbon source. These results also demonstrated the feasibility of scaling up 
      and reusing the medium for additional biomass and lipid production.

AB  - In this study, a glutathione S-transferase gene (gst) from sensitive Physarum 
      polycephalum was selected for its ability to detect nanosized TiO(2) (nTiO(2) ) 
      exposure under dark conditions. The concentration of nTiO(2) (25, 40 and 60 nm) for 
      subsequent assays was first determined (5-18 mg ml(-1) ) and total GST enzyme 
      activity of P. polycephalum was confirmed to be increased 6-44 fold in groups 
      treated with nTiO(2) . Second, an RNA-seq study was performed to identify candidate 
      gst genes before isolation of an optimum gst gene of P. polycephalum (Ppgst), which 
      encoded 223 amino acids. Third, the transcriptional level of the Ppgst gene was 
      further confirmed to be positively correlated with nTiO(2) exposure within the 
      concentration range of (5-15 mg ml(-1) ) by qPCR. In conclusion, these results 
      indicated that the transcriptional level of Ppgst can reflect nTiO(2) exposure, 
      suggesting that it may be employed as a new biomarker for nTiO(2) pollution under 
      dark conditions. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study identifies a new 
      gst gene for indicating nanosized TiO(2) under dark conditions and provides a new 
      option for detection of nanosized TiO(2) pollution under dark conditions.

TI  - Physarum polycephalum expresses a dihydropteridine reductase with selectivity for 
      pterin substrates with a 6-(1', 2'-dihydroxypropyl) substitution.
PG  - 1057-62
AB  - Physarum polycephalum is one of few non-animal organisms capable of synthesizing 
      tetrahydrobiopterin from GTP. Here we demonstrate developmentally regulated 
      expression of quinoid dihydropteridine reductase (EC 1.6.99.7), an enzyme required 
      for recycling 6,7-[8H]-dihydrobiopterin. Physarum also expresses 
      phenylalanine-4-hydroxylase activity, an enzyme that depends on dihydropteridine 
      reductase. The 24.4 kDa Physarum dihydropteridine reductase shares 43% amino acid 
      identity with the human protein. A number of residues important for function of the 
      mammalian enzyme are also conserved in the Physarum sequence. In comparison to sheep 
      liver dihydropteridine reductase, purified recombinant Physarum dihydropteridine 
      reductase prefers pterin substrates with a 6-(1', 2'-dihydroxypropyl) group. Our 
      results demonstrate that Physarum synthesizes, utilizes and metabolizes 
      tetrahydrobiopterin in a way hitherto thought to be restricted to the animal 
      kingdom.

AB  - Activation of a phytochrome photoreceptor triggers a program of Physarum 
      polycephalum plasmodial cell differentiation through which a mitotic multinucleate 
      protoplasmic mass synchronously develops into haploid spores formed by meiosis and 
      rearrangement of cellular components. We have performed a transcriptome-wide RNAseq 
      study of cellular reprogramming and developmental switching. RNAseq analysis 
      revealed extensive remodeling of intracellular signaling and regulation in switching 
      the expression of sets of genes encoding transcription factors, kinases, 
      phosphatases, signal transduction proteins, RNA-binding proteins, ubiquitin ligases, 
      regulators of the mitotic and meiotic cell cycle etc. in conjunction with the 
      regulation of genes encoding metabolic enzymes and cytoskeletal proteins. About 15% 
      of the differentially expressed genes shared similarity with members of the 
      evolutionary conserved set of core developmental genes of social amoebae. 
      Differential expression of genes encoding regulators that act at the 
      transcriptional, translational, and post-translational level indicates the 
      establishment of a new state of cellular function and reveals evolutionary deeply 
      conserved molecular changes involved in cellular reprogramming and differentiation 
      in a prototypical eukaryote.

TI  - A revised model of fluid transport optimization in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 567-581
LID - 10.1007/s00285-016-1036-y [doi]
AB  - Optimization of fluid transport in the slime mold Physarum polycephalum has been the 
      subject of several modeling efforts in recent literature. Existing models assume 
      that the tube adaptation mechanism in P. polycephalum's tubular network is 
      controlled by the sheer amount of fluid flow through the tubes. We put forward the 
      hypothesis that the controlling variable may instead be the flow's pressure gradient 
      along the tube. We carry out the stability analysis of such a revised mathematical 
      model for a parallel-edge network, proving that the revised model supports the 
      global flow-optimizing behavior of the slime mold for a substantially wider class of 
      response functions compared to previous models. Simulations also suggest that the 
      same conclusion may be valid for arbitrary network topologies.

TI  - Physarum polycephalum haemagglutinins: effect of nutrition on synthesis, and their 
      possible role in nature.
PG  - 2315-22
AB  - The activity of haemagglutinins in plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum was measured 
      under different culture conditions. The activity was markedly increased when the 
      plasmodia were incubated in a non-nutrient salt medium. During starvation, 
      significant amounts of haemagglutinins were found in the slime layer on the surface 
      of the plasmodia. An increase in activity was not observed in the presence of 
      actinomycin D or cycloheximide. Under starvation conditions, plasmodia are known to 
      differentiate into either sclerotia (spherules) or fruiting bodies. Acceleration of 
      haemagglutinin synthesis, however, was not always observed during spherulation and 
      fruiting-body formation. Attempts to detect endogenous glycoconjugates that bind to 
      the haemagglutinins were unsuccessful but we found that the haemagglutinins could 
      bind to acidic polysaccharides produced by Escherichia coli K12. The bacterial 
      glycoconjugates were purified and partially characterized. They contained 
      N-acetylhexosamine residues which appeared to be important for binding with the 
      haemagglutinins. It is possible that the haemagglutinins play a physiological role 
      in the interaction with these organisms.

TI  - Semi-in vitro detection of Mg(2+)-dependent DNase that specifically digest 
      mitochondrial nucleoids in the zygote of Physarum polycephalum.

AB  - The maternal/uniparental inheritance of mitochondria is controlled by the selective 
      elimination of paternal/uniparental mitochondria and digestion of their 
      mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). In isogamy, the selective digestion of mtDNA in 
      uniparental mitochondria is initiated after mating and is completed prior to the 
      elimination of mitochondria, but the molecular mechanism of the digestion of 
      uniparental mtDNA remains unknown. In this study, we developed a semi-in vitro assay 
      for DNase, wherein the digestion of mitochondrial nucleoids (mt-nucleoids) was 
      microscopically observed using isolated mitochondria from Physarum polycephalum and 
      the DNase involved in uniparental inheritance was characterized. When myxamoebae of 
      AI35 and DP246 are crossed, mtDNA and mt-nucleoid from only the DP246 parent are 
      digested. The digestion of mt-nucleoids was observed in zygotes 3 h after plating 
      for mating. During the digestion of mt-nucleoids, mitochondrial membrane integrity 
      was maintained. In the semi-in vitro assay, the digestion of mt-nucleoids was only 
      observed in the presence of Mg(2+) at pH 7.5-9.0. Moreover, such Mg(2+)-dependent 
      DNase activity was specifically detected in mitochondria isolated from zygotes 3 h 
      after plating for mating. Therefore, Mg(2+)-dependent DNase is potentially involved 
      in uniparental inheritance. Our findings provide insights into the DNase involved in 
      uniparental inheritance and its regulatory mechanism.

TI  - Random network peristalsis in Physarum polycephalum organizes fluid flows across an 
      individual.

AB  - Individuals can function as integrated organisms only when information and resources 
      are shared across a body. Signals and substrates are commonly moved using fluids, 
      often channeled through a network of tubes. Peristalsis is one mechanism for fluid 
      transport and is caused by a wave of cross-sectional contractions along a tube. We 
      extend the concept of peristalsis from the canonical case of one tube to a random 
      network. Transport is maximized within the network when the wavelength of the 
      peristaltic wave is of the order of the size of the network. The slime mold Physarum 
      polycephalum grows as a random network of tubes, and our experiments confirm 
      peristalsis is used by the slime mold to drive internal cytoplasmic flows. 
      Comparisons of theoretically generated contraction patterns with the patterns 
      exhibited by individuals of P. polycephalum demonstrate that individuals maximize 
      internal flows by adapting patterns of contraction to size, thus optimizing 
      transport throughout an organism. This control of fluid flow may be the key to 
      coordinating growth and behavior, including the dynamic changes in network 
      architecture seen over time in an individual.

TI  - The Physarum polycephalum php gene encodes a unique cold-adapted serine-carboxyl 
      peptidase, physarolisin II.
PG  - 340-4
AB  - The php gene from a true slime mold, Physarum polycephalum, is a late-replicating 
      and transcriptionally active gene. The deduced amino acid sequence of the gene 
      product is homologous to those of the serine-carboxyl peptidase family, including 
      physarolisin I from the same organism, but lacks the propeptide region. In this 
      study, the protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and shown to possess 
      endopeptidase activity with unique substrate specificity. Thus, we named it 
      physarolisin II. The enzyme was revealed to be a kind of cold-adapted enzyme since 
      it was maximally active at 16-22 degrees C. The active enzyme was markedly unstable 
      due to rapid autolysis (t(1/2)= approximately 5 min, at 18 degrees C). At higher 
      temperature, the enzyme was less active but more stable, despite the fact that no 
      gross conformational change was observed by circular dichroism spectroscopy.

TI  - Mechanosensation Mediates Long-Range Spatial Decision-Making in an Aneural Organism.
PG  - e2008161
LID - 10.1002/adma.202008161 [doi]
AB  - The unicellular protist Physarum polycephalum is an important emerging model for 
      understanding how aneural organisms process information toward adaptive behavior. 
      Here, it is revealed that Physarum can use mechanosensation to reliably make 
      decisions about distant objects in its environment, preferentially growing in the 
      direction of heavier, substrate-deforming, but chemically inert masses. This 
      long-range sensing is abolished by gentle rhythmic mechanical disruption, changing 
      substrate stiffness, or the addition of an inhibitor of mechanosensitive transient 
      receptor potential channels. Additionally, it is demonstrated that Physarum does not 
      respond to the absolute magnitude of strain. Computational modeling reveales that 
      Physarum may perform this calculation by sensing the fraction of its perimeter that 
      is distorted above a threshold substrate strain-a fundamentally novel method of 
      mechanosensation. Using its body as both a distributed sensor array and 
      computational substrate, this aneural organism leverages its unique morphology to 
      make long-range decisions. Together, these data identify a surprising behavioral 
      preference relying on biomechanical features and quantitatively characterize how the 
      Physarum exploits physics to adaptively regulate its growth and shape.

AB  - The plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum is a unicellular and multinuclear giant 
      amoeba. The plasmodium has the ability to sense and adapt to many kinds of 
      environmental stimuli, and its optimization behavior in closed spaces has been 
      analyzed extensively. However, few studies have tested the behavior of the 
      plasmodium in an open spaces, despite the biological importance of the adaptability 
      of biological entities in such conditions. Accordingly, we established an 
      experimental setup with a very large and strictly homogeneous substrate and observed 
      the long-term exploratory behavior of the plasmodium. As a result, we found that the 
      movement of the plasmodium was consistent with a Lévy-walk, but with anisotropic 
      bias.

TI  - Mitochondrial fusion and inheritance of the mitochondrial genome.
PG  - 131-8
AB  - Although maternal or uniparental inheritance of mitochondrial genomes is a general 
      rule, biparental inheritance is sometimes observed in protists and fungi,including 
      yeasts. In yeast, recombination occurs between the mitochondrial genomes inherited 
      from both parents.Mitochondrial fusion observed in yeast zygotes is thought to set 
      up a space for DNA recombination. In the last decade,a universal mitochondrial 
      fusion mechanism has been uncovered, using yeast as a model. On the other hand, an 
      alternative mitochondrial fusion mechanism has been identified in the true slime 
      mold Physarum polycephalum.A specific mitochondrial plasmid, mF, has been detected 
      as the genetic material that causes mitochondrial fusion in P. polycephalum. Without 
      mF, fusion of the mitochondria is not observed throughout the life cycle, suggesting 
      that Physarum has no constitutive mitochondrial fusion mechanism.Conversely, 
      mitochondria fuse in zygotes and during sporulation with mF. The complete mF 
      sequence suggests that one gene, ORF640, encodes a fusogen for Physarum 
      mitochondria. Although in general, mitochondria are inherited uniparentally, 
      biparental inheritance occurs with specific sexual crossing in P. polycephalum.An 
      analysis of the transmission of mitochondrial genomes has shown that recombinations 
      between two parental mitochondrial genomes require mitochondrial fusion,mediated by 
      mF. Physarum is a unique organism for studying mitochondrial fusion.

AB  - Plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum is a model species of eukaryotic microorganisms 
      for studying amoeboid movement. Plasmodium's natural movements are characterized by 
      the rhythmic back-and-forth streaming of cytoplasm peristalsis, which results in the 
      directed locomotion of plasmodium, and the periodic change of the electric potential 
      on the surface of plasmodium. Although it was suggested the causal connection 
      between the cytoplasmic streaming and the electric potential in P. polycephalum, the 
      relationship between its plasmodium peristaltic behavior and the surface electric 
      potential had not been statistically proven. In this study, based on the modern 
      microscopic observation and the new electric potential measurement, we proved the 
      consistence between the frequency spectrums of the electric potential wave and the 
      peristaltic wave during the growth of plasmodium and the synchronization of their 
      waveforms through cross-correlational analysis. And we concluded that the 
      correlation exists between the peristaltic wave and the electric potential wave. 
      This study added new evidence to the hypothesis of the sharing inner biological 
      mechanism between plasmodium's peristaltic behavior and electric potential as 
      previous studies indicated, and brought a new perspective towards the future 
      research on amoeboid movement.

AB  - The functional relationship between the velocity of cell locomotion and 
      intracellular spatial patterns of thickness oscillations in the acellular slime 
      mould Physarum polycephalum was studied. The freely migrating plasmodial cells of 
      300-800 µm length were tadpole-shaped and displayed thickness oscillations along 
      their longitudinal (body) axis. Two distinct patterns of intracellular thickness 
      oscillations were observed in dependence on the locomotive velocity. The first mode 
      consisted of a single travelling wave that propagated from the rear to the front of 
      the cell. This pattern occurred when the plasmodium migrated slowly. The second mode 
      was a multinodal standing wave that was found during events of fast propagation. 
      Transitions between these two types of cell thickness oscillation patterns took 
      place in narrow propagation velocity intervals. We discuss the possible mechanism 
      leading to these patterns, which are conjectured to modulate both the intracellular 
      pressure and the velocity of free locomotion of the cell.

AB  - The plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum is often used in the implementation of 
      non-linear computation to solve optimization problems, and this organismal feature 
      was not used in this analysis to compute perception and/or sensation in humans. In 
      this paper, we focused on the Kanizsa illusion, which is a well-known visual 
      illusion resulting from the differentiation-integration of the visual field, and 
      compared the illusion with the adaptive network in the plasmodium of P. 
      polycephalum. We demonstrated that the network pattern mimicking the Kanizsa 
      illusion can be produced by an asynchronous automata-fashioned model of the foraging 
      slime mold and by the real plasmodia of P. polycephalum. Because the protoplasm of 
      the plasmodium is transported depending on both local and global computation, it may 
      contain differentiation-integration processes. In this sense, we can extend the idea 
      of perception and computation.

LID - 10.1042/CBI20090158 [doi]
AB  - The plasmodium Physarum polycephalum exhibits periodic cycles of cytoplasmic 
      streaming in association with those of contraction and relaxation movement. In the 
      present study, we injected Calcium Green dextran as a fluorescent Ca2+ indicator 
      into the thin-spread living plasmodium. We found changes in the [Ca2+]i 
      (intracellular concentration of Ca2+), which propagated in a wave-like form in its 
      cytoplasm. The Ca2+ waves were also detected when we used Fura dextran which 
      detected [Ca2+]i by the ratio of two wavelengths. We prepared the plasmodial 
      fragment from the thin-spread and found that the cycles of the 
      contraction-relaxation movement was so synchronized that the measurement of its area 
      provided an indication of the movement. We observed that [Ca2+]i also synchronized 
      in the entire fragment and that the relaxation ensued upon the reduction in [Ca2+]i. 
      We suggest that the Ca2+ wave generated periodically is one of the major factors 
      playing a crucial role in the relaxation of P. polycephalum.

      polycephalum.
PG  - 115
LID - 10.1186/1471-2164-11-115 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Physarum polycephalum is a free-living amoebozoan protist displaying a 
      complex life cycle, including alternation between single- and multinucleate stages 
      through sporulation, a simple form of cell differentiation. Sporulation in Physarum 
      can be experimentally induced by several external factors, and Physarum displays 
      many biochemical features typical for metazoan cells, including metazoan-type 
      signaling pathways, which makes this organism a model to study cell cycle, cell 
      differentiation and cellular reprogramming. RESULTS: In order to identify the genes 
      associated to the light-induced sporulation in Physarum, especially those related to 
      signal transduction, we isolated RNA before and after photoinduction from 
      sporulation- competent cells, and used these RNAs to synthesize cDNAs, which were 
      then analyzed using the 454 sequencing technology. We obtained 16,669 cDNAs that 
      were annotated at every computational level. 13,169 transcripts included hit count 
      data, from which 2,772 displayed significant differential expression (upregulated: 
      1,623; downregulated: 1,149). Transcripts with valid annotations and significant 
      differential expression were later integrated into putative networks using 
      interaction information from orthologs. CONCLUSIONS: Gene ontology analysis 
      suggested that most significantly downregulated genes are linked to DNA repair, cell 
      division, inhibition of cell migration, and calcium release, while highly 
      upregulated genes were involved in cell death, cell polarization, maintenance of 
      integrity, and differentiation. In addition, cell death- associated transcripts were 
      overrepresented between the upregulated transcripts. These changes are associated to 
      a network of actin-binding proteins encoded by genes that are differentially 
      regulated before and after light induction.

TI  - Pteridine biosynthesis and nitric oxide synthase in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 105-11
AB  - Physarum polycephalum, an acellular slime mould, serves as a model system to study 
      cell-cycle-dependent events since nuclear division is naturally synchronous. This 
      organism was shown to release isoxanthopterin which is structurally related to 
      tetrahydrobiopterin, a cofactor of aromatic amino acid hydroxylases and of nitric 
      oxide synthases (NOSs) (EC 1.14.13.39). Here, we studied Physarum pteridine 
      biosynthesis in more detail and found that high amounts of tetrahydrobiopterin are 
      produced and NOS activity is expressed. Physarum pteridine biosynthesis is peculiar 
      in as much as 7,8-dihydroneopterin aldolase (EC 4.1.2.25), an enzyme of folic acid 
      biosynthesis usually not found in organisms producing tetrahydrobiopterin, is 
      detected in parallel. NOS purified from Physarum depends on NADPH, 
      tetrahydrobiopterin and flavins. Enzyme activity is independent of exogenous Ca2+ 
      and is inhibited by arginine analogues. The purified enzyme (with a molecular mass 
      of 130 kDa) contains tightly bound tetrahydrobiopterin and flavins. During the 
      synchronous cell cycle of Physarum, pteridine biosynthesis increases during S-phase 
      whereas NOS activity peaks during mitosis, drops at telophase and peaks again during 
      early S-phase. Our results characterize Physarum pteridine biosynthesis and NOS and 
      suggest a possible link between NOS activity and mitosis.

TI  - Structure of Physarum polycephalum cytochrome b5 reductase at 1.56 A resolution.
PG  - 274-9
AB  - Physarum polycephalum cytochrome b(5) reductase catalyzes the reduction of 
      cytochrome b(5) by NADH. The structure of P. polycephalum cytochrome b(5) reductase 
      was determined at a resolution of 1.56 A. The molecular structure was compared with 
      that of human cytochrome b(5) reductase, which had previously been determined at 
      1.75 A resolution [Bando et al. (2004), Acta Cryst. D60, 1929-1934]. The 
      high-resolution structure revealed conformational differences between the two 
      enzymes in the adenosine moiety of the FAD, the lid region and the linker region. 
      The structural properties of both proteins were inspected in terms of hydrogen 
      bonding, ion pairs, accessible surface area and cavity volume. The differences in 
      these structural properties between the two proteins were consistent with estimates 
      of their thermostabilities obtained from differential scanning calorimetry data.

      proteins.
PG  - 691-700
LID - 10.1042/BJ20080192 [doi]
AB  - Physarum polycephalum expresses two closely related, calcium-independent NOSs 
      (nitric oxide synthases). In our previous work, we showed that both NOSs are induced 
      during starvation and apparently play a functional role in sporulation. In the 
      present study, we characterized the genomic structures of both Physarum NOSs, 
      expressed both enzymes recombinantly in bacteria and characterized their biochemical 
      properties. Whereas the overall genomic organization of Physarum NOS genes is 
      comparable with various animal NOSs, none of the exon-intron boundaries are 
      conserved. Recombinant expression of clones with various N-termini identified 
      N-terminal amino acids essential for enzyme activity, but not required for haem 
      binding or dimerization, and suggests the usage of non-AUG start codons for Physarum 
      NOSs. Biochemical characterization of the two Physarum isoenzymes revealed different 
      affinities for L-arginine, FMN and 6R-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-L-biopterin.

AB  - Complex distribution networks are pervasive in biology. Examples include nutrient 
      transport in the slime mold Physarum polycephalum as well as mammalian and plant 
      venation. Adaptive rules are believed to guide development of these networks and 
      lead to a reticulate, hierarchically nested topology that is both efficient and 
      resilient against perturbations. However, as of yet, no mechanism is known that can 
      generate such networks on all scales. We show how hierarchically organized 
      reticulation can be constructed and maintained through spatially correlated load 
      fluctuations on a particular length scale. We demonstrate that the network 
      topologies generated represent a trade-off between optimizing transport efficiency, 
      construction cost, and damage robustness and identify the Pareto-efficient front 
      that evolution is expected to favor and select for. We show that the typical 
      fluctuation length scale controls the position of the networks on the Pareto front 
      and thus on the spectrum of venation phenotypes.

AB  - Information regarding the effect of nanoscale titanium dioxide particles (nTiO(2)) 
      on the environment under dark conditions is scarce, and the effect of nTiO(2) on 
      fungi is largely unknown. Due to its huge size and high sensitivity to external 
      stimuli, the slime mold fungi cell, Physarum polycephalum macroplasmodium, was 
      utilized as a novel subject for the toxicity investigations in the present study, 
      and oxidative stress from nTiO(2) on the macroplasmodium was assessed under dark 
      conditions. Short exposure (2-3 h) caused an intracellular reactive oxygen species 
      (ROS) imbalance, and an anti-oxidative mechanism was activated from intermediate 
      doses of nTiO(2) (5-18 mg/mL). At long exposure times (~3 days), relatively low 
      doses of nTiO(2) (≤9 mg/mL) stimulated the growth of macroplasmodium and oxidative 
      stress without DNA damage, whereas higher doses of nTiO(2) (≥15 mg/mL) led to growth 
      inhibition, significant DNA oxidative damage, and activation of the DNA 
      single-strand repairing system. Although DNA oxidative damage was decreased to the 
      same level as the control group by the supplementation of the anti-oxidant vitamin 
      C, growth of the macroplasmodium failed to be completely restored. We inferred that 
      nTiO(2) induced a complicated toxicity effect on P. polycephalum in addition to DNA 
      oxidative damage. Taken as a whole, the present study implied the probability of 
      using P. polycephalum macroplasmodium for toxicity studies at the single-cell level, 
      indicating that nTiO(2) could induce oxidative stress or damage in P. polycephalum 
      even under dark conditions and suggesting that the release of nTiO(2) could lead to 
      a growth imbalance of slime molds in the environment.

TI  - Encoding memory in tube diameter hierarchy of living flow network.
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2007815118 [doi]
LID - e2007815118
AB  - The concept of memory is traditionally associated with organisms possessing a 
      nervous system. However, even very simple organisms store information about past 
      experiences to thrive in a complex environment-successfully exploiting nutrient 
      sources, avoiding danger, and warding off predators. How can simple organisms encode 
      information about their environment? We here follow how the giant unicellular slime 
      mold Physarum polycephalum responds to a nutrient source. We find that the 
      network-like body plan of the organism itself serves to encode the location of a 
      nutrient source. The organism entirely consists of interlaced tubes of varying 
      diameters. Now, we observe that these tubes grow and shrink in diameter in response 
      to a nutrient source, thereby imprinting the nutrient's location in the tube 
      diameter hierarchy. Combining theoretical model and experimental data, we reveal how 
      memory is encoded: a nutrient source locally releases a softening agent that gets 
      transported by the cytoplasmic flows within the tubular network. Tubes receiving a 
      lot of softening agent grow in diameter at the expense of other tubes shrinking. 
      Thereby, the tubes' capacities for flow-based transport get permanently upgraded 
      toward the nutrient location, redirecting future decisions and migration. This 
      demonstrates that nutrient location is stored in and retrieved from the networks' 
      tube diameter hierarchy. Our findings explain how network-forming organisms like 
      slime molds and fungi thrive in complex environments. We here identify a flow 
      networks' version of associative memory-very likely of relevance for the plethora of 
      living flow networks as well as for bioinspired design.

TI  - Emergence of behaviour in a self-organized living matter network.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.62863 [doi]
LID - e62863
AB  - What is the origin of behaviour? Although typically associated with a nervous 
      system, simple organisms also show complex behaviours. Among them, the slime mold 
      Physarum polycephalum, a giant single cell, is ideally suited to study emergence of 
      behaviour. Here, we show how locomotion and morphological adaptation behaviour 
      emerge from self-organized patterns of rhythmic contractions of the actomyosin 
      lining of the tubes making up the network-shaped organism. We quantify the 
      spatio-temporal contraction dynamics by decomposing experimentally recorded 
      contraction patterns into spatial contraction modes. Notably, we find a continuous 
      spectrum of modes, as opposed to a few dominant modes. Our data suggests that the 
      continuous spectrum of modes allows for dynamic transitions between a plethora of 
      specific behaviours with transitions marked by highly irregular contraction states. 
      By mapping specific behaviours to states of active contractions, we provide the 
      basis to understand behaviour's complexity as a function of biomechanical dynamics.

AB  - Nano-sized TiO(2) (nTiO(2)) exerts an oxidative effect on cells upon exposure to 
      solar or UV irradiation and ecotoxicity of the nTiO(2) is an urgent concern. Little 
      information is available regarding the effect of TiO(2) on cells under dark 
      conditions. Metabolomics is a unique approach to the discovery of biomarkers of 
      nTiO(2) cytotoxicity, and leads to the identification of perturbed metabolic 
      pathways and the mechanism underlying nTiO(2) toxicity. In the present study, gas 
      chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS)-based metabolomics was performed to 
      investigate the effect of nTiO(2) on sensitive cells (P. polycephalum 
      macroplasmodium) under dark conditions. According to the multivariate pattern 
      recognition analysis, at least 60 potential metabolic biomarkers related to sugar 
      metabolism, amino acid metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, polyamine biosynthesis, 
      and secondary metabolites pathways were significantly perturbed by nTiO(2). Notably, 
      many metabolic biomarkers and pathways were related to anti-oxidant mechanisms in 
      the living organism, suggesting that nTiO(2) may induce oxidative stress, even under 
      dark conditions. This speculation was further validated by the biochemical levels of 
      reactive oxygen species (ROS), 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), and total 
      soluble phenols (TSP). We inferred that the oxidative stress might be related to 
      nTiO(2)-induced imbalance of cellular ROS. To the best of our knowledge, the present 
      study is the first to investigate the nTiO(2)-induced metabolic perturbations in 
      slime mold, provide a new perspective of the mechanism underlying nTiO(2) toxicity 
      under dark conditions, and show that metabolomics can be employed as a rapid, 
      reliable and powerful tool to investigate the interaction among organisms, the 
      environment, and nanomaterials.

AB  - The giant single-celled slime mould Physarum polycephalum exhibits complex 
      morphological adaptation and amoeboid movement as it forages for food and may be 
      seen as a minimal example of complex robotic behaviour. Swarm computation has 
      previously been used to explore how spatio-temporal complexity can emerge from, and 
      be distributed within, simple component parts and their interactions. Using a 
      particle-based swarm approach we explore the question of how to generate collective 
      amoeboid movement from simple non-oscillatory component parts in a model of P. 
      polycephalum. The model collective behaves as a cohesive and deformable virtual 
      material, approximating the local coupling within the plasmodium matrix. The 
      collective generates de-novo and complex oscillatory patterns from simple local 
      interactions. The origin of this motor behaviour distributed within the collective 
      rendering is morphologically adaptive, amenable to external influence and robust to 
      simulated environmental insult. We show how to gain external influence over the 
      collective movement by simulated chemo-attraction (pulling towards nutrient stimuli) 
      and simulated light irradiation hazards (pushing from stimuli). The amorphous and 
      distributed properties of the collective are demonstrated by cleaving it into two 
      independent entities and fusing two separate entities to form a single device, thus 
      enabling it to traverse narrow, separate or tortuous paths. We conclude by 
      summarizing the contribution of the model to swarm-based robotics and soft-bodied 
      modular robotics and discuss the future potential of such material approaches to the 
      field.

TI  - Replication forks reverse at high frequency upon replication stress in Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 577-85
LID - 10.1007/s00412-014-0471-z [doi]
AB  - The addition of hydroxyurea after the onset of S phase allows replication to start 
      and permits the successive detecting of replication-dependent joint DNA molecules 
      and chicken foot structures in the synchronous nuclei of Physarum polycephalum. We 
      find evidence for a very high frequency of reversed replication forks upon 
      replication stress. The formation of these reversed forks is dependent on the 
      presence of joint DNA molecules, the impediment of the replication fork progression 
      by hydroxyurea, and likely on the propensity of some replication origins to 
      reinitiate replication to counteract the action of this compound. As hydroxyurea 
      treatment enables us to successively detect the appearance of joint DNA molecules 
      and then of reversed replication forks, we propose that chicken foot structures are 
      formed both from the regression of hydroxyurea-frozen joint DNA molecules and from 
      hydroxyurea-stalled replication forks. These experiments underscore the transient 
      nature of replication fork regression, which becomes detectable due to the 
      hydroxyurea-induced slowing down of replication fork progression.

AB  - Left-right patterning and lateralised behaviour is an ubiquitous aspect of plants 
      and animals. The mechanisms linking cellular chirality to the large-scale asymmetry 
      of multicellular structures are incompletely understood, and it has been suggested 
      that the chirality of living cells is hardwired in their cytoskeleton. We examined 
      the question of biased asymmetry in a unique organism: the slime mould Physarum 
      polycephalum, which is unicellular yet possesses macroscopic, complex structure and 
      behaviour. In laboratory experiment using a T-shape, we found that Physarum turns 
      right in more than 74% of trials. The results are in agreement with previously 
      published studies on asymmetric movement of muscle cells, neutrophils, liver cells 
      and growing neural filaments, and for the first time reveal the presence of 
      consistently-biased laterality in the fungi kingdom. Exact mechanisms of the slime 
      mould's direction preference remain unknown.

TI  - Robust and emergent Physarum logical-computing.
PG  - 45-55
AB  - There have been many attempts for realization of emergent computing, but the notion 
      of emergent computing is still ambiguous. In an open system, emergence and an error 
      cannot be specified distinctly, because they are dependent on the dis-equilibration 
      process between local and global behaviors. To manifest such an aspect, we implement 
      a Boolean gate as a biological device made of slime mold Physarum polycephalum. A 
      Physarum (slime mold) Boolean gate could be an internally instable machine, while it 
      has the potential for emergent computing. First, we examined whether Physarum 
      Boolean gate works properly, and then examined its behaviors when the gate is 
      collapsed in terms of hardware. The behavior of Physarum changes and self-repairing 
      computing is achieved as a result. The self-repairing against internal failure is 
      one of attributes of emergent and robust computing.

TI  - DNA polymerase delta of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 534-45
AB  - DNA polymerase delta from the phylogenetically ancient slime mold Physarum 
      polycephalum has been 380-fold enriched from amoebae. It was found to have the 
      properties typical for this type of DNA polymerase from higher eukaryotes with 
      regard to effectors, template-primer acceptance, co-purification with 
      3'-5'-exonuclease activity, as well as the effect of endogenous proliferating cell 
      nuclear antigen (PCNA) from amoebae on the stimulation and processivity of DNA 
      synthesis. An identified cDNA fragment shows 65.5% identical amino acides with DNA 
      polymerase delta from Saccharomyces pombe. The molecular mass of the polymerase is 
      125 kDa while that of PCNA is 35 kDa. During size-exclusion chromatography, the 
      highly purified polymerase eluted in the position of 125 kDa, suggesting that no 
      other proteins were tightly complexed with the enzyme. The DNA polymerases from the 
      (mononucleate) amoebae and from the (multinucleate) plasmodia of P. polycephalum 
      have very similar properties in contrast to their differences in phenotype and their 
      mode of nuclear division. The polymerase shows a higher degree of similarity than 
      DNA polymerase alpha, and especially the beta-like DNA polymerase, with the 
      corresponding polymerases of higher eukaryotes. According to antibody staining, DNA 
      polymerase delta is readily fragmented by proteases, even in the presence of 
      inhibitor cocktails. Including freshly prepared cell lysates, proteolytic fragments 
      are reproducible, the most abundant being 50 kDa in size. The DNA polymerase is 
      recognized by the antisera against two peptides which have been derived by 
      PCR-screening of plasmodial cDNA. One of the proteolytic splitting sites is located 
      within an eight amino-acid stretch between the two antigenic sequences.

TI  - Adaptive behaviour and learning in slime moulds: the role of oscillations.
PG  - 20190757
LID - 10.1098/rstb.2019.0757 [doi]
LID - 20190757
AB  - The slime mould Physarum polycephalum, an aneural organism, uses information from 
      previous experiences to adjust its behaviour, but the mechanisms by which this is 
      accomplished remain unknown. This article examines the possible role of oscillations 
      in learning and memory in slime moulds. Slime moulds share surprising similarities 
      with the network of synaptic connections in animal brains. First, their topology 
      derives from a network of interconnected, vein-like tubes in which signalling 
      molecules are transported. Second, network motility, which generates slime mould 
      behaviour, is driven by distinct oscillations that organize into spatio-temporal 
      wave patterns. Likewise, neural activity in the brain is organized in a variety of 
      oscillations characterized by different frequencies. Interestingly, the oscillating 
      networks of slime moulds are not precursors of nervous systems but, rather, an 
      alternative architecture. Here, we argue that comparable information-processing 
      operations can be realized on different architectures sharing similar oscillatory 
      properties. After describing learning abilities and oscillatory activities of P. 
      polycephalum, we explore the relation between network oscillations and learning, and 
      evaluate the organism's global architecture with respect to information-processing 
      potential. We hypothesize that, as in the brain, modulation of spontaneous 
      oscillations may sustain learning in slime mould. This article is part of the theme 
      issue 'Basal cognition: conceptual tools and the view from the single cell'.

TI  - Physarum machines: encapsulating reaction-diffusion to compute spanning tree.
PG  - 975-80
AB  - The Physarum machine is a biological computing device, which employs plasmodium of 
      Physarum polycephalum as an unconventional computing substrate. A reaction-diffusion 
      computer is a chemical computing device that computes by propagating diffusive or 
      excitation wave fronts. Reaction-diffusion computers, despite being computationally 
      universal machines, are unable to construct certain classes of proximity graphs 
      without the assistance of an external computing device. I demonstrate that the 
      problem can be solved if the reaction-diffusion system is enclosed in a membrane 
      with few 'growth points', sites guiding the pattern propagation. Experimental 
      approximation of spanning trees by P. polycephalum slime mold demonstrates the 
      feasibility of the approach. Findings provided advance theory of reaction-diffusion 
      computation by enriching it with ideas of slime mold computation.

TI  - Emergence of morphological order in the network formation of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 253-60
AB  - Emergence in a system appears through the interaction of its components, giving rise 
      to higher order or complexity in the system. We tested for the presence of emergent 
      properties in a biological system using the simplest biological entity of a 
      unicellular organism; the plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum, a giant unicellular 
      amoeboid organism that forms a network-like tubular structure connecting its food 
      sources. We let two plasmodium networks within a single cell interact with each 
      other, and observed how the intracellular interaction affected the morphologenesis 
      of the plasmodium networks. We found that the two networks developed homologous 
      morphology. We further discuss the presence of autonomous and emergent properties in 
      homologous network formation.

TI  - THYMIDINE INCORPORATION BY MITOCHONDRIA IN PHYSARUM POLYCEPHALUM.
PG  - 1057-8
AB  - Cytoplasmic particles of the slime-mold, Physarum polycephalum, incorporate 
      tritiated thymidine in a form which is insoluble in acid and in ribonuclease, and 
      soluble in deoxyribonuclease. Evidence for the mitochondrial nature of these 
      thymidine-incorporating particles is based on their distribution, size, and staining 
      behavior.

AB  - Motivated by recent experimental studies, we derive and analyze a two-dimensional 
      model for the contraction patterns observed in protoplasmic droplets of Physarum 
      polycephalum. The model couples a description of an active poroelastic two-phase 
      medium with equations describing the spatiotemporal dynamics of the intracellular 
      free calcium concentration. The poroelastic medium is assumed to consist of an 
      active viscoelastic solid representing the cytoskeleton and a viscous fluid 
      describing the cytosol. The equations for the poroelastic medium are obtained from 
      continuum force balance and include the relevant mechanical fields and an 
      incompressibility condition for the two-phase medium. The reaction-diffusion 
      equations for the calcium dynamics in the protoplasm of Physarum are extended by 
      advective transport due to the flow of the cytosol generated by mechanical stress. 
      Moreover, we assume that the active tension in the solid cytoskeleton is regulated 
      by the calcium concentration in the fluid phase at the same location, which 
      introduces a mechanochemical coupling. A linear stability analysis of the 
      homogeneous state without deformation and cytosolic flows exhibits an oscillatory 
      Turing instability for a large enough mechanochemical coupling strength. Numerical 
      simulations of the model equations reproduce a large variety of wave patterns, 
      including traveling and standing waves, turbulent patterns, rotating spirals and 
      antiphase oscillations in line with experimental observations of contraction 
      patterns in the protoplasmic droplets.

TI  - Biological activities and chemical compositions of slime tracks and crude 
      exopolysaccharides isolated from plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum and Physarella 
      oblonga.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The myxomycetes derive their common name (slime molds) from the 
      multinucleate trophic stage (plasmodium) in the life cycle, which typically produces 
      a noticeable amount of slimy materials, some of which is normally left behind as a 
      "slime track" as the plasmodium migrates over the surface of a particular substrate. 
      The study reported herein apparently represents the first attempt to investigate the 
      chemical composition and biological activities of slime tracks and the 
      exopolysaccharides (EPS) which cover the surface of the plasmodia of Physarum 
      polycephalum and Physarella oblonga. RESULTS: Chemical analyses indicated that the 
      slime tracks and samples of the EPS consist largely of carbohydrates, proteins and 
      various sulphate groups. Galactose, glucose and rhamnose are the monomers of the 
      cabohydrates present. The slime tracks of both species and the EPS of Phy. oblonga 
      contained rhamnose, but the EPS of Ph. polycephalum had glucose as the major 
      monomer. In term of biological activities, the slime tracks displayed no 
      antimicrobial activity, low anticancer activity and only moderate antioxidant 
      activity. However, EPSs from both species showed remarkable antimicrobial 
      activities, especially toward Candida albicans (zone of inhibition ≥20 mm). Minimum 
      inhibitory concentrations of this fungus were found to be 2560 μg/mL and 1280 μg/mL 
      for EPS from Phy. oblonga and Ph. polycephalum, respectively. These EPS samples also 
      showed moderate antioxidant activities. However, they both displayed cytotoxicity 
      towards MCF-7 and HepG2 cancer cells. Notably, EPS isolated from the plasmodium of 
      Phy. oblonga inhibited the cell growth of MCF-7 and HepG2 at the half inhibitory 
      concentration (IC50) of 1.22 and 1.11 mg/mL, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: EPS from Ph. 
      polycephalum plasmodium could be a potential source of antifungal compounds, and EPS 
      from Phy. oblonga could be a potential source of anticancer compounds.

TI  - Alternative pathway of respiration in Physarum polycephalum plasmodia.
PG  - 85-90
AB  - The external application of inhibitors of glycolysis in the presence of KCN shows a 
      lethal effect on plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum. However, alpha-ketoglutarate, 
      but not succinate, maintains the contraction-relaxation cycle of plasmodial 
      actomyosin in spite of the fact that glycolysis and cytochrome oxidase are 
      inhibited. The oscillations supported by ketoglutarate disappear in the presence of 
      SHAM, an inhibitor of alternative oxidase. These results imply the existence of 
      KCN-resistant, alternative pathway of electron transport in the mitochondria of 
      Physarum polycephalum.

TI  - Plasmodial vein networks of the slime mold Physarum polycephalum form regular 
      graphs.
PG  - 046113
AB  - The morphology of a typical developing biological transportation network, the vein 
      network of the plasmodium of the myxomycete Physarum polycephalum is analyzed during 
      its free extension. The network forms a classical, regular graph, and has 
      exclusively nodes of degree 3. This contrasts to most real-world transportation 
      networks which show small-world or scale-free properties. The complexity of the vein 
      network arises from the weighting of the lengths, widths, and areas of the vein 
      segments. The lengths and areas follow exponential distributions, while the widths 
      are distributed log-normally. These functional dependencies are robust during the 
      entire evolution of the network, even though the exponents change with time due to 
      the coarsening of the vein network.

TI  - A novel Physarum polycephalum SR protein kinase specifically phosphorylates the RS 
      domain of the human SR protein, ASF/SF2.
PG  - 657-67
AB  - A 1591-bp cDNA of a serine-rich protein kinase (SRPK)-like protein has been 
      identified in Physarum polycephalum (GenBank accession No. DQ140379). The cDNA 
      contains two repeat sequences at bp 1-153 and bp 395-547. The encoding sequence is 
      56% homologous to human SRPK1 and is named Physarum SRPK (PSRPK). Consistent with 
      other SRPKs, the consensus motifs of PSRPK are within the two conserved domains 
      (CDs). However, divergent motifs between the N-terminal and CDs are much shorter 
      than the corresponding sequences of other SRPKs. To study the structure and function 
      of this protein, we performed co-expression experiment in Escherichia coli and in 
      vitro phosphorylation assay to investigate the phosphorylation effect of recombinant 
      PSRPK on the human SR protein, ASF/SF2. Western blot analysis showed that PSRPK 
      could phosphorylate ASF/SF2 in E. coli cells. Autoradiographic examination showed 
      that both recombinant PSRPK and a truncated form of PSRPK with a 28-aa deletion at 
      the N-terminus could phosphorylate ASF/SF2 and a truncated form of ASF/SF2 that 
      contains the RS domain. However, these two forms of PSRPK could not phosphorylate a 
      truncated form ASF/SF2 that lacks the RS domain. A truncated form of PSRPK that 
      lacks either of CDs does not have any phosphorylation activity. These results 
      indicated that, like other SRPKs, the phosphorylation site in PSRPK is located 
      within the RS domain of the SR protein and that its phosphorylation activity is 
      closely associated with the two CDs. This study on the structure and function of 
      PSRPK demonstrates that it is a new member of the SRPK family.

AB  - Speed-accuracy trade-offs (SATs) are thought to be a fundamental feature of 
      biological information processing, yet most evidence of SATs comes from animals. 
      Here, we examine SATs in the foraging decisions of an acellular, amoeboid organism: 
      the slime mould Physarum polycephalum. Slime moulds were given a simple 
      discrimination task: selecting the highest-quality food item from a set of three 
      options. We investigated the effect of two stressors, light exposure and hunger, on 
      the speed and accuracy of decision-making. We also examined the effect of task 
      difficulty. When given a difficult discrimination task, stressed individuals tend to 
      make faster decisions than non-stressed individuals. This effect was reversed in 
      plasmodia given easy discrimination tasks, where stressed individuals made slower 
      decisions than non-stressed individuals. We found evidence of SATs, such that 
      individuals who made fast decisions were more likely to make costly errors by 
      selecting the worst possible food option. Our results suggest that SATs occur in a 
      wider range of taxa than previously considered.

TI  - Spectroscopic detection of a phytochrome-like photoreceptor in the myxomycete 
      Physarum polycephalum and the kinetic mechanism for the photocontrol of sporulation 
      by Pfr.
PG  - 697-702
AB  - Sporulation of the true slime mold Physarum polycephalum (Myxomycetales) can be 
      triggered by the far-red/red reversible Physarum phytochrome. Physarum plasmodia 
      were analyzed with a purpose-built dual-wavelength photometer that is designed for 
      phytochrome measurements. A photoreversible absorbance change at 670 nm was 
      monitored after actinic red (R) and far-red (FR) irradiation of starved plasmodia, 
      confirming the occurrence of a phytochrome-like photoreceptor in Physarum 
      spectroscopically. These signals were not found in growing plasmodia, suggesting the 
      Physarum phytochrome to be synthesized during starvation, which makes the cells 
      competent for the photoinduction of sporulation. The photoconversion rates by R and 
      FR light were similar in the phytochromes of Physarum and etiolated oat shoots. In 
      dark-grown Physarum plasmodia that had not been preexposed to any light only R 
      induced a detectable absorbance change while FR did not. This indicates that most 
      (at least 90%) of the photoreversible pigment occurs in the red-absorbing form. 
      Since the effectiveness of FR in triggering sporulation was enhanced by 
      preirradiation with R, it is concluded that at least part of the Pr can be 
      photoconverted to the active Pfr photoreceptor species. We propose a kinetic 
      mechanism for the photocontrol of sporulation by photoconversion of Pfr, which may 
      also hold for the high-irradiance response to FR in Arabidopsis and Cuscuta.

TI  - MASS CULTURE OF A SLIME MOLD, PHYSARUM POLYCEPHALUM.
PG  - 161-4
AB  - The slime mold, Physarum polycephalum, was cultivated in a soluble natural medium in 
      shake flasks and in 30-liter and 50-gal conventional baffled fermentors. Yields of 6 
      to 10 g (dry weight) per liter were obtained in the large-scale fermentations. 
      Because of the slow growth of the myxomycete, particular attention had to be paid to 
      aseptic technique. The inability of this organism to withstand the normal degree of 
      agitation employed with most aerobic fermentations made it difficult to obtain 
      adequate aeration. Conditions for growth of the organism on a pilot-plant scale are 
      presented.

TI  - Physarum vitronectin-like protein has extensive homology to dihydrolipoamide 
      acetyltransferase.
PG  - 323-31
AB  - Physarum vitronectin-like protein with a molecular mass of 70 kDa cross-reacts with 
      anti-bovine vitronectin and promotes cell-spreading (Miyazaki, K. et al. 1992. Exp. 
      Cell Res., 199: 106-110.). The amino-terminal sequence of Physarum vitronectin-like 
      protein is, however, distinct from those of animal vitronectins but shows 
      significant sequence homology with dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase, a component 
      of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. We have investigated the structural relationships 
      between Physarum vitronectin-like protein and dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase by 
      using both antibody and protein-chemical methods. The vitronectin-like protein 
      reacted with both anti-bovine vitronectin IgG and anti-rat pyruvate dehydrogenase 
      complex IgG, indicating that it shares common antigenic determinant(s) with rat 
      pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Furthermore, sequencing studies of peptides obtained 
      by lysylendopeptidase digestion indicated that internal sequences of Physarum 
      vitronectin-like protein show significant homology with dihydrolipoamide 
      acetyltransferase, but do not show any homology with the primary structures of 
      authentic vitronectins. Immunocytochemistry revealed that the protein is widely 
      localized in cytoplasm and nuclei of Physarum polycephalum, but is not present in 
      the central area of vacuoles. Our results indicate that Physarum vitronectin-like 
      protein is a molecule structurally and immunologically related to dihydrolipoamide 
      acetyltransferase but functionally similar to animal vitronectin, although its 
      localization is unique.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of glutathione reductase from Physarum polycephalum 
      and stage-specific expression of the enzyme in life-cycle stages with different 
      oxidation-reduction levels.
PG  - 317-23
AB  - Physarum polycephalum has a life cycle with several distinct phases that have 
      different oxidation-reduction requirements. To investigate the relationship between 
      the life cycle and the oxidation-reduction state, we isolated glutathione reductase 
      (GR; EC 1.6.4.2) from Physarum microplasmodia. The enzyme was found to be a 
      homodimer with a subunit M(r) of 49,000, and K(m) values for oxidized glutathione 
      and NADPH of 40 and 28.6 microM, respectively. We then constructed a cDNA library 
      from microplasmodium mRNA and cloned GR cDNA from the library. The isolated cDNA 
      consisted of 1,475 bp encoding a polypeptide of 452 amino acids. The amino acid 
      sequence similarity was about 50% with GRs of other organisms, and several conserved 
      sequence motifs thought to be necessary for activity are evident in the Physarum 
      enzyme. Escherichia coli transformed with an expression vector containing the cDNA 
      synthesized the active GR. Genomic Southern blot analysis indicated that the GR gene 
      is present as a single copy in the Physarum genome. Immunoblot analysis and RT-PCR 
      analysis detected GR mRNA expression in the microplasmodium, plasmodium, and 
      sclerotium, but not in the spore or flagellate. GR activity was low in the spore and 
      flagellate. These results suggest that the glutathione oxidation-reduction system 
      relates to the Physarum life cycle.

AB  - DNA polymerase alpha and DNA polymerase alpha--primase complex of Physarum 
      polycephalum were purified by rapid methods, and antibodies were raised against the 
      complex. In crude extracts, immune-reactive polypeptides of 220 kDa, 180 kDa, 150 
      kDa, 140 kDa, 110 kDa, 86 kDa, 57 kDa and 52 kDa were identified. The structural 
      relationships between the 220 kDa, 110 kDa and 140 kDa (the most abundant form) was 
      investigated by peptide mapping. The 140 kDa form was active DNA polymerase alpha. 
      The 57 kDa and the 52 kDa polypeptides were identified as primase subunits by 
      auto-catalytic labelling. In amoebae, the immune-reactive 140 kDa polypeptide was 
      replaced by a 135 kDa active DNA polymerase alpha.

AB  - Single-celled organisms show a fascinating faculty for integrating spatial 
      information and adapting their behaviour accordingly. As such they are of potential 
      interest for elucidating fundamental mechanisms of developmental biology. In this 
      mini-review we highlight current research on two organisms, the true slime mould 
      Physarum polycephalum and the ciliates Paramecium and Tetrahymena. For each of 
      these, we present a case study how applying physical principles to explain behaviour 
      can lead to the understanding of general principles possibly relevant to 
      developmental biology.

TI  - Identification of substrates for transglutaminase in Physarum polycephalum, an 
      acellular slime mold, upon cellular mechanical damage.
PG  - 2766-77
AB  - Transglutaminases are Ca(2+)-dependent enzymes that post-translationally modify 
      proteins by crosslinking or polyamination at specific polypeptide-bound glutamine 
      residues. Physarum polycephalum, an acellular slime mold, is the evolutionarily 
      lowest organism expressing a transglutimase whose primary structure is similar to 
      that of mammalian transglutimases. We observed transglutimase reaction products at 
      injured sites in Physarum macroplasmodia upon mechanical damage. With use of a 
      biotin-labeled primary amine, three major proteins constituting possible 
      transglutimase substrates were affinity-purified from the damaged slime mold. The 
      purified proteins were Physarum actin, a 40 kDa Ca(2+)-binding protein with four 
      EF-hand motifs (CBP40), and a novel 33 kDa protein highly homologous to the 
      eukaryotic adenine nucleotide translocator, which is expressed in mitochondria. 
      Immunochemical analysis of extracts from the damaged macroplasmodia indicated that 
      CBP40 is partly dimerized, whereas the other proteins migrated as monomers on 
      SDS/PAGE. Of the three proteins, CBP40 accumulated most significantly around injured 
      areas, as observed by immunofluoresence. These results suggested that transglutimase 
      reactions function in the response to mechanical injury.

TI  - Use of the giant multinucleate plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum to study RNA 
      interference in the myxomycete.
PG  - 194-9
AB  - The plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum harbors billions of synchronized nuclei in a 
      single cell of complex structure. Due to its synchrony and extreme size, it is used 
      as a model to study events on a single cell level, such as cell cycle and 
      differentiation. We show here for the first time that this model, despite its 
      enormous size and structural complexity, is accessible to RNA interference by simple 
      injection of dsRNA or siRNA. The targeted gene is that of polymalatase, an 
      intracellular adapter of poly(beta-l-malate) involved in the maintenance of the 
      synchrony and functioning as an extracellular hydrolase of this polymer. Real-time 
      reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the specific 
      mRNA was knocked down to about 10% of the original level. The suppression of a 
      single injection lasted for approximately 14 cell cycles (144 h) and could be 
      prolonged for any time by repeated dsRNA injections. Western blots indicated that 
      the knockdown of RNA was paralleled by a strong reduction in polymalatase synthesis. 
      However, a change in the phenotype of the plasmodium could not be clearly observed. 
      In principle, the plasmodium offers an easy system for studying gene knockdown by 
      RNA interference.

AB  - Zerumbone, a natural cyclic sesquiterpene, has been the focus of recent research as 
      it has been found to exhibit selective toxicity towards cancer cells compared to 
      normal cells. Studies on the cell cycle phase-specific effects of this interesting 
      compound, however, remain sparse. Hence, concentration and time-dependent effects of 
      zerumbone were evaluated employing a suitable model system, the naturally 
      synchronous surface cultures of Physarum polycephalum. Zerumbone treatment in S, 
      early, and late G2 phases resulted in G2 arrest. Early G2 phase exhibited the 
      highest sensitivity (P < 0.001) to the compound. Protein profiles showed a complete 
      inhibition of cyclin B1 expression following zerumbone treatment. Furthermore, FACS 
      and comet analysis revealed that zerumbone inhibited DNA synthesis (P < 0.001) 
      without being genotoxic at the concentrations tested. Differential display of mRNA 
      showed distinct zerumbone-induced variations in transcript profiles, an analysis of 
      which suggested a likely link between cellular networks involving stress-related 
      gene expression and G2 arrest in P. polycephalum.

PG  - 39-44
AB  - cDNA encoding DNA topoisomerase I from Physarum polycephalum was isolated from a 
      poly(A)+ -primed library (3'-region) and by PCR (5'-region). The coding region of 
      cDNA was 3045 bp, encoding a polypeptide of molecular mass of 112 kDa. Identity 
      between predicted amino acids sequences of conserved domains and corresponding 
      domains from another eukaryotic type I DNA topoisomerases varied from 33.2 to 53.5% 
      for the core domain and from 33.8 to 57.4% for the C-terminal domain. A peculiar 
      feature of Physarum DNA topoisomerase I was a stretch of repeated KPAX...X motifs in 
      the N-terminal domain of the polypeptide. Although treatment of the plasmodia with 
      db-cAMP increased relaxing activity of the DNA topoisomerase I several-fold, there 
      was only a slight increase in the mRNA level.

AB  - The chemotactic and chemotropic responses of the plasmodial stage of the slime mold 
      Physarum polycephalum were used to distinguish Salmonella gallinarum and Salmonella 
      pullorum from 10 Salmonella serovars that are commonly isolated from domestic 
      poultry. Utilizing an in vitro plasmodium agar plate assay method, P. polycephalum 
      was attracted to S. gallinarum and S. pullorum, but the organism was repelled by 
      Salmonella derby, Salmonella dublin, Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella heidelberg, 
      Salmonella minnesota, Salmonella montevideo, Salmonella newington, Salmonella 
      newport, Salmonella reading, and Salmonella typhimurium.

AB  - Nonlinear dynamic processes involving the differential regulation of transcription 
      factors are considered to impact the reprogramming of stem cells, germ cells, and 
      somatic cells. Here, we fused two multinucleate plasmodial cells of Physarum 
      polycephalum mutants defective in different sporulation control genes while being in 
      different physiological states. The resulting heterokaryons established one of two 
      significantly different expression patterns of marker genes while the plasmodial 
      halves that were fused to each other synchronized spontaneously. Spontaneous 
      synchronization suggests that switch-like control mechanisms spread over and finally 
      control the entire plasmodium as a result of cytoplasmic mixing. Regulatory 
      molecules due to the large volume of the vigorously streaming cytoplasm will define 
      concentrations in acting on the population of nuclei and in the global setting of 
      switches. Mixing of a large cytoplasmic volume is expected to damp stochasticity 
      when individual nuclei deliver certain RNAs at low copy number into the cytoplasm. 
      We conclude that spontaneous synchronization, the damping of molecular noise in gene 
      expression by the large cytoplasmic volume, and the option to take multiple 
      macroscopic samples from the same plasmodium provide unique options for studying the 
      dynamics of cellular reprogramming at the single cell level.

AB  - When deciding between different options, animals including humans face the dilemma 
      that fast decisions tend to be erroneous, whereas accurate decisions tend to be 
      relatively slow. Recently, it has been suggested that differences in the efficacy 
      with which animals make a decision relate closely to individual behavioural 
      differences. In this paper, we tested this hypothesis in a unique unicellular 
      organism, the slime mould Physarum polycephalum. We first confirmed that slime 
      moulds differed consistently in their exploratory behaviour from 'fast' to 'slow' 
      explorers. Second, we showed that slow explorers made more accurate decisions than 
      fast explorers. Third, we demonstrated that slime moulds integrated food cues in 
      time and achieved higher accuracy when sampling time was longer. Lastly, we showed 
      that in a competition context, fast explorers excelled when a single food source was 
      offered, while slow explorers excelled when two food sources varying in quality were 
      offered. Our results revealed that individual differences in accuracy were partly 
      driven by differences in exploratory behaviour. These findings support the 
      hypothesis that decision-making abilities are associated with behavioural types, 
      even in unicellular organisms.

TI  - Slime molds response to carbon nanotubes exposure: from internalization to behavior.
PG  - 511-526

AB  - Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) offer attractive opportunities due to their physical, 
      electrical, mechanical, optical, and thermal properties. They are used in a wide 
      range of applications and are found in numerous consumer products. On the downside, 
      their increasing presence in the environment poses potential threats to living 
      organisms and ecosystems. The aim of this study was to evaluate the toxicity of 
      double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs) on a new model system: the acellular slime 
      mold Physarum polycephalum. Despite its ecological significance, its simplicity of 
      organization, and its behavioral complexity, exposure of such organisms to 
      nanoparticles has been poorly investigated. Slime molds were exposed to DWCNTs using 
      three routes of exposure (topical, food, environment). We first demonstrated that 
      DWCNTs were rapidly internalized by slime molds especially when DWCNTs were mixed 
      with the food or spread out in the environment. Secondly, we showed that a 6-week 
      exposure to DWCNTs did not lead to bioaccumulation nor did it lead to persistence in 
      the slime molds when they entered a resting stage. Thirdly, we revealed that 2 days 
      following exposure, DWCNTs were almost entirely excreted from the slime molds. 
      Lastly, we uncovered that DWCNTs exposure altered the migration speed, the 
      pseudopods formation, and the expansion rate of the slime molds. Our results extend 
      our current knowledge of CNTs cytotoxicity and introduce P. polycephalum as an ideal 
      organism for nanotoxicology.

AB  - The slime mould Physarum polycephalum has been used in developing unconventional 
      computing devices for in which the slime mould played a role of a sensing, 
      actuating, and computing device. These devices treated the slime mould as an active 
      living substrate, yet it is a self-consistent living creature which evolved over 
      millions of years and occupied most parts of the world, but in any case, that living 
      entity did not own true cognition, just automated biochemical mechanisms. To 
      "rehabilitate" slime mould from the rank of a purely living electronics element to a 
      "creature of thoughts" we are analyzing the cognitive potential of P. polycephalum. 
      We base our theory of minimal cognition of the slime mould on a bottom-up approach, 
      from the biological and biophysical nature of the slime mould and its regulatory 
      systems using frameworks such as Lyon's biogenic cognition, Muller, di 
      Primio-Lengelerś modifiable pathways, Bateson's "patterns that connect" framework, 
      Maturana's autopoietic network, or proto-consciousness and Morgan's Canon.

TI  - Characterization of 101-kDa transglutaminase from Physarum polycephalum and 
      identification of LAV1-2 as substrate.
PG  - 29888-95
AB  - Plasmodial transglutaminase of Physarum polycephalum was purified by anion exchange 
      and hydrophobic chromatography. Gel filtration and SDS-polyacrylamide gel 
      electrophoresis indicate that it is a monomer of 96-101 kDa. It is Ca2+-dependent, 
      with half-maximal activity at 0. 7 mM Ca2+. Optimal activity occurs at pH 7.5 and at 
      50 mM KCl. Inactivation by N-ethylmaleimide indicates that it is a thiol enzyme. 
      With N,N-dimethylcasein as substrate, the Km for monodansylcadaverine is 33.9 +/- 
      1.8 microM. Damage of plasmodia by brief treatment with 15% ethanol activates the 
      transglutaminase, with rapid accumulation of cross-linked proteins unable to enter 
      gels during SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Added monodansylcadaverine is 
      conjugated principally to LAV1-2, a plasmodia-specific 40-kDa protein with four 
      EF-hand sequences believed to bind Ca2+. Actin is seen as an additional substrate 
      only in plasmodial homogenates. Immunoblots show that upon ethanol treatment, a 
      portion of LAV1-2 is modified quickly and shifts to 36 kDa; another portion is 
      cross-linked to itself or other proteins. The modification of LAV1-2 may lead to 
      localized release of Ca2+ and activation of transglutaminase for walling off damaged 
      areas of plasmodia. No significant increase in amount of the transglutaminase occurs 
      during starvation-induced differentiation of plasmodia to form spherules, but a 50% 
      reduction in the amount of total protein leads to a doubling in the specific mass of 
      the TGase. Neither the transglutaminase nor LAV1-2 is found in the ameboid form of 
      the organism.

TI  - [Transient expression in microplasmodia of Physarum polycephalum].
PG  - 854-62
AB  - The plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum is a suitable eukaryotic cell for cell cycle 
      investigation, but there is no compatible transient expression system for the 
      plasmodium. Using the promoter and terminator of ardC actin of Physarum polycephalum 
      substituted the CMV IE and SV40 polyA of plasmid pDsRedl-N1, using cassette 
      PardC-MCS-DsRed1-TardC substituted the cassette PardC-hph-TardC of plasmid pTB38, we 
      constructed plasmids pXM1 and pXM2 for transient expression of red fluorescent 
      protein (RFP) in Physarum polycephalum respectively. After reconstituting the 
      transcription elongation factor homologous gene (pelf1) of Physarum polycephalum 
      into the pXM2, we generated a plasmid pXM2-pelf1. After the plasmid pXM1, pXM2 and 
      pXM2-pelf1 were electroporated into the plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum, we 
      observed optimum RFP and PELF1-RFP expression under fluoroscope and confocal 
      microscope between 24-48 h after electroporation, and found that ELF1-RFP expression 
      was accumulated in nucleus of microplasmodium, the optimum electroporation 
      parameters were 40 V/cm electric field, 1 ampere current, and 70 micros electric 
      shock time. The results suggest that this expression system is qualified for 
      transient expression of specific protein in plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum.

TI  - The complete DNA sequence of the mitochondrial genome of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 539-45
AB  - The complete sequence of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of the true slime mold 
      Physarun polycephalum has been determined. The mtDNA is a circular 62,862-bp 
      molecule with an A+T content of 74.1%. A search with the program BLAST X identified 
      the protein-coding regions. The mitochondrial genome of P. polycephalum was 
      predicted to contain genes coding for 12 known proteins [for three cytochrome c 
      oxidase subunits, apocytochrome b, two F1Fo-ATPase subunits, five NADH dehydrogenase 
      (nad) subunits, and one ribosomal protein], two rRNA genes, and five tRNA genes. 
      However, the predicted ORFs are not all in the same frame, because mitochondrial RNA 
      in P. polycephalum undergoes RNA editing to produce functional RNAs. The nucleotide 
      sequence of an nad7 cDNA showed that 51 nucleotides were inserted at 46 sites in the 
      mRNA. No guide RNA-like sequences were observed in the mtDNA of P. polycephalum. 
      Comparison with reported Physarum mtDNA sequences suggested that sites of RNA 
      editing vary among strains. In the Physarum mtDNA, 20 ORFs of over 300 nucleotides 
      were found and ORFs 14 19 are transcribed.

TI  - Progress in plasmodial differentiation improves regularity of oscillating 
      contractions in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 11-5
AB  - Based on the knowledge about subcellular morphogenetic processes in the acellular 
      slime mold Physarum polycephalum, we hypothesized that during differentiation of 
      undifferentiated endoplasm to the highly differentiated complex structure of the 
      contractile apparatus of this organism, the regularity of oscillating contractions 
      must improve. We measured the endogenous contraction automaticity starting from the 
      de novo generation within minutes after sampling small portions of undifferentiated 
      endoplasm. The standard deviation of the normalized period duration of these samples 
      was compared to the respective values of radial contractions of differentiated 
      protoplasmic plasmodial strands. The mean normalized standard deviation in 
      endoplasmic drops was 28.3+/-12.2%. Respective values in protoplasmic strands were 
      10.0+/-3.7%. The difference between the experimental groups was highly significant 
      (p<<0.0001). We interpret the verification of our hypothesis as an indication that 
      the very regular oscillating contractions in fully differentiated stages of Physarum 
      require the complex structure of the sophisticated contractile apparatus, 
      represented by the circular plasmalemma invagination system of protoplasmic strands, 
      while the regularity is lower in stages, where the differentiation is still in 
      progress. We believe that this is due to deficits in coordination capabilities, 
      which need a directional and spatially oriented protoplasmic streaming as a 
      precondition.

PG  - 601-11
LID - 10.1007/s00412-010-0281-x [doi]
AB  - Transient four stranded joint DNA molecules bridging sister chromatids constitute an 
      intriguing feature of replicating genomes. Here, we studied their structure and 
      frequency of formation in Physarum polycephalum. By "3D gels", we evidenced that 
      they are not made of four continuous DNA strands. Discontinuities, which do not 
      interfere with the unique propensity of the joint DNA molecules to branch migrate in 
      vitro, are linked to the crossover, enhanced by RNaseA, and affect at most half of 
      the DNA strands. We propose a structural model of joint DNA molecules containing 
      ribonucleotides inserted within one strand, a gapped strand, and two continuous DNA 
      strands. We further show that spontaneous joint DNA molecules are short-lived and 
      are as abundant as replication forks. Our results emphasize the highly frequent 
      formation of joint DNA molecules involving newly replicated DNA in an untreated cell 
      and uncover a transitory mechanism connecting the sister chromatids during S phase.

AB  - A single-celled, multi-nucleated amoeboid organism, a plasmodium of the true slime 
      mold Physarum polycephalum, can perform sophisticated computing by exhibiting 
      complex spatiotemporal oscillatory dynamics while deforming its amorphous body. We 
      previously devised an "amoeba-based computer (ABC)" to quantitatively evaluate the 
      optimization capability of the amoeboid organism in searching for a solution to the 
      traveling salesman problem (TSP) under optical feedback control. In ABC, the 
      organism changes its shape to find a high quality solution (a relatively shorter TSP 
      route) by alternately expanding and contracting its pseudopod-like branches that 
      exhibit local photoavoidance behavior. The quality of the solution serves as a 
      measure of the optimality of which the organism maximizes its global body area 
      (nutrient absorption) while minimizing the risk of being illuminated (exposure to 
      aversive stimuli). ABC found a high quality solution for the 8-city TSP with a high 
      probability. However, it remains unclear whether intracellular communication among 
      the branches of the organism is essential for computing. In this study, we conducted 
      a series of control experiments using two individual cells (two single-celled 
      organisms) to perform parallel searches in the absence of intercellular 
      communication. We found that ABC drastically lost its ability to find a solution 
      when it used two independent individuals. However, interestingly, when two 
      individuals were prepared by dividing one individual, they found a solution for a 
      few tens of minutes. That is, the two divided individuals remained correlated even 
      though they were spatially separated. These results suggest the presence of a 
      long-term memory in the intrinsic dynamics of this organism and its significance in 
      performing sophisticated computing.

LID - 10.1016/j.jtbi.2008.09.010 [doi]
AB  - Branching network growth patterns, depending on environmental conditions, in 
      plasmodium of true slime mold Physarum polycephalum were investigated. Surprisingly, 
      the patterns resemble those in bacterial colonies even though the biological 
      mechanisms differ greatly. Bacterial colonies are collectives of microorganisms in 
      which individual organisms have motility and interact through nutritious and 
      chemical fields. In contrast, the plasmodium is a giant amoeba-like multinucleated 
      unicellular organism that forms a network of tubular structures through which 
      protoplasm streams. The cell motility of the plasmodium is generated by oscillation 
      phenomena observed in the partial bodies, which interact through the tubular 
      structures. First, we analyze characteristics of the morphology quantitatively, then 
      we abstract local rules governing the growing process to construct a simple network 
      growth model. This model is independent of specific systems, in which only two rules 
      are applied. Finally, we discuss the mechanism of commonly observed biological 
      pattern formations through comparison with the system of bacterial colonies.

TI  - Function of c-Fos-like and c-Jun-like proteins on trichostatin A-induced G2/M arrest 
      in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 767-72
AB  - The homologs of transcription factors c-Fos and c-Jun have been detected in slime 
      mold Physarum polycephalum during progression of the synchronous cell cycle. Here we 
      demonstrated that c-Fos-like and c-Jun-like proteins participated in G2/M transition 
      by the regulation of the level of Cyclin B1 protein in P. polycephalum. The study of 
      antibody neutralization revealed that interruption of the functions of c-Fos-like 
      and c-Jun-like proteins resulted in G2/M transition arrest, implicating their 
      functional roles in cell cycle control. When G2/M transition was blocked by histone 
      deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A, changes in c-Fos- and c-Jun-like protein 
      levels, and hyperacetylation of c-Jun-like protein, were observed. The data suggest 
      that in P. polycephalum, c-Fos- and c-Jun-like proteins may be the key factors in 
      the regulation of histone acetylation-related G2/M transition, involving the 
      coordinated expression and hyperacetylation of these proteins.

TI  - Non-DNA-templated addition of nucleotides to the 3' end of RNAs by the mitochondrial 
      RNA polymerase of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 5795-802
LID - 10.1128/MCB.00356-08 [doi]
AB  - Mitochondrial gene expression is necessary for proper mitochondrial biogenesis. 
      Genes on the mitochondrial DNA are transcribed by a dedicated mitochondrial RNA 
      polymerase (mtRNAP) that is encoded in the nucleus and imported into mitochondria. 
      In the myxomycete Physarum polycephalum, nucleotides that are not specified by the 
      mitochondrial DNA templates are inserted into some RNAs, a process called RNA 
      editing. This is an essential step in the expression of these RNAs, as the insertion 
      of the nontemplated nucleotides creates open reading frames for the production of 
      proteins from mRNAs or produces required secondary structure in rRNAs and tRNAs. The 
      nontemplated nucleotide is added to the 3' end of the RNA as the RNA is being 
      synthesized during mitochondrial transcription. Because RNA editing is 
      cotranscriptional, the mtRNAP is implicated in RNA editing as well as transcription. 
      We have cloned the cDNA for the mtRNAP of Physarum and have expressed the mtRNAP in 
      Escherichia coli. We have used in vitro transcription assays based on the Physarum 
      mtRNAP to identify a novel activity associated with the mtRNAP in which 
      non-DNA-templated nucleotides are added to the 3' end of RNAs. Any of the four 
      ribonucleoside triphosphates (rNTPs) can act as precursors for this process, and 
      this novel activity is observed when only one rNTP is supplied, a condition under 
      which transcription does not occur. The implications of this activity for the 
      mechanism of RNA editing are discussed.

TI  - Identification of a ras gene in the slime mold Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 357-9
AB  - A ras homologue was identified in the cDNA library from the slime mold Physarum 
      polycephalum. The cDNA codes for a protein of 189 amino acids, showing high homology 
      to ras genes from other organisms, especially to these from Dictyostelium 
      discoideum. Amino acid sequence at the C-terminus of the putative protein suggests 
      that unlike most other ras proteins, it is not palmitoylated and bears a 
      geranylgeranyl rather than farnesyl chain.

TI  - Identification of a putative mitochondrial RNA polymerase from Physarum 
      polycephalum: characterization, expression, purification, and transcription in 
      vitro.
PG  - 259-71
AB  - Mitochondrial RNA polymerases (mtRNAPs) are necessary for the biogenesis of 
      mitochondria and for proper mitochondrial function since they transcribe genes on 
      mtDNA for tRNAs, rRNAs, and mRNAs. The unique type of RNA editing identified in 
      mitochondria of Physarum polycephalum is thought to be closely associated with 
      transcription, and as such, RNA editing activity would be expected to be closely 
      associated with the mtRNAP. In order to better characterize the role of mtRNAPs in 
      mitochondrial biogenesis and to determine the role of the Physarum mtRNAP in RNA 
      editing, the cDNA of the Physarum mtRNAP was identified using PCR and degenerate 
      primers designed from conserved motifs in mtRNAPs. This amplification product was 
      used to screen a cDNA library for the cDNA corresponding to the Physarum mtRNAP. A 
      cDNA corresponding to a 3.2 kb transcript containing a 997 codon open reading frame 
      was identified. The amino acid sequence inferred from the open reading frame 
      contains motifs characteristic of mtRNAPs. To confirm that a cDNA for an RNA 
      polymerase had been isolated, the cDNA was expressed in E. coli as an N-terminal 
      maltose binding protein (MBP) fusion protein. The fusion protein was purified by 
      affinity chromatography and shown to have DNA-directed RNA polymerase activity. This 
      functional mtRNAP will be useful for in vitro studies of mitochondrial transcription 
      and RNA editing.

LID - 10.1186/1471-2091-10-22 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Serine/arginine (SR) protein-specific kinases (SRPKs) are conserved in a 
      wide range of organisms, from humans to yeast. Studies showed that SRPKs can 
      regulate the nuclear import of SR proteins in cytoplasm, and regulate the 
      sub-localization of SR proteins in the nucleus. But no nuclear localization signal 
      (NLS) of SRPKs was found. We isolated an SRPK-like protein PSRPK (GenBank accession 
      No. DQ140379) from Physarum polycephalum previously, and identified a NLS of PSRPK 
      in this study. RESULTS: We carried out a thorough molecular dissection of the 
      different domains of the PSRPK protein involved in its nuclear localization. By 
      truncation of PSRPK protein, deletion of and single amino acid substitution in a 
      putative NLS and transfection of mammalian cells, we observed the distribution of 
      PSRPK fluorescent fusion protein in mammalian cells using confocal microscopy and 
      found that the protein was mainly accumulated in the nucleus; this indicated that 
      the motif contained a nuclear localization signal (NLS). Further investigation with 
      truncated PSPRK peptides showed that the NLS (318PKKGDKYDKTD328) was localized in 
      the alkaline Omega-loop of a helix-loop-helix motif (HLHM) of the C-terminal 
      conserved domain. If the 318PKKGDK322 sequence was deleted from the loop or K320 was 
      mutated to T320, the PSRPK fluorescent fusion protein could not enter and accumulate 
      in the nucleus. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the 318PKKGDKYDKTD328 
      peptides localized in the C-terminal conserved domain of PSRPK with the Omega-loop 
      structure could play a crucial role in the NLS function of PSRPK.

PG  - 143-50
AB  - We have investigated Physarum polycephalum, a unicellular organism with no special 
      gravity receptors, on its ability to react to gravity. The first experiments were 0 
      g-simulation experiments on the fast-rotating clinostat conducted with plasmodial 
      strands of this acellular slime mold. In these earth-bound experiments the observed 
      parameters were periodicity of the contractions and dilatations of the strand's 
      ectoplasm as well as the periodicity and velocity of the striking cytoplasmic 
      (endoplasmic) shuttle streaming. During 0 g-simulation these parameters showed 
      significant changes indicating the existence of a gravisensitivity of the slime 
      mold. The Space-Shuttle experiment (ESA-Biorack in D 1-Mission) should demonstrate 
      the validity of the 0 g-simulation on the fast-rotating clinostat. The experiment 
      was designed in a way enabling the registration of the same parameters as on the 
      clinostat (using the light microscope in combination with a photo diode and a 
      cinecamera). Only one of the two planned measurement sessions was fully successful 
      and provided us with data confirming the results gained on the fast-rotating 
      clinostat: The slime mold showed under real near weightlessness in the D 1-Space 
      Shuttle Mission a transient frequency increase in tis contraction rhythmicity and a 
      (steady) increase in the streaming velocity of its endoplasm.

TI  - Analysis of chromatin assembled in vivo using exogenous histones in Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 86-92
AB  - Histones are involved in the regulation of almost all events within the eukaryotic 
      cell nucleus that utilize DNA as a substrate. We have developed a novel approach for 
      examining the function of histone proteins and specific domains of these proteins in 
      these various nuclear processes, and in particular assembly of chromatin throughout 
      the cell cycle. This approach exploits several unique characteristics of the slime 
      mold Physarum polycephalum, including the natural synchrony of all (approximately 
      10(8)) nuclei throughout the cell cycle and the ability of this organism to take up 
      exogenous proteins. Here, culture techniques and biochemical procedures for the

TI  - Localization of fluorescence-labeled poly(malic acid) to the nuclei of the 
      plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 1536-42
AB  - The nuclei in the plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum, as of other myxomycetes, 
      contain high amounts of polymalate, which has been proposed to function as a 
      scaffold for the carriage and storage of several DNA-binding proteins [Angerer, B. 
      and Holler, E. (1995) Biochemistry 34, 14741-14751]. By delivering 
      fluorescence-labeled polymalate into a growing plasmodium by injection, we observed 
      microscopic staining of nuclei in agreement with the proposed function. The 
      fluorescence intensity was highest during the reconstruction phase of the nuclei. To 
      examine whether the delivery was under the control of polymalatase or related 
      proteins [Karl, M. & Holler, E. (1998) Eur. J. Biochem.251, 405-412], the cellular 
      distribution of these proteins was also examined by staining with antibodies against 
      polymalatase. Double-stained plasmodia revealed a fluorescent halo around each 
      fluorescent nucleus during the reconsititution. Fluorescent nuclei were not observed 
      when the hydroxyl terminus of polymalate, known to be essential for the binding of 
      polymalatase, was blocked by labeling with fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate. By immune 
      precipitation, it was shown that polymalate and polymalatase or related proteins 
      were in the precipitate. It is concluded that polymalate is delivered to the surface 
      of nuclei in the complex with polymalatase or related proteins. The complex 
      dissociates, and polymalate translocates into the nucleus, while polymalatase or 
      related proteins remain at the surface.

TI  - Properties, intracellular localization, and stage-specific expression of 
      membrane-bound beta-glucosidase, BglM1, from Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 2141-50
LID - 10.1016/j.biocel.2008.02.019 [doi]
AB  - Physarum polycephalum expresses a membrane-bound beta-glucosidase (BglM1) with a 
      molecular mass of 130 kDa. The primary structure of BglM1 consists of a glycosyl 
      hydrolase family 3 domain at an amino-terminal domain and a carboxyl-terminal region 
      without homology to the sequence of known glycosidases. The latter region contains 
      two calx-beta motifs known as Ca(2+)-binding sites; an RGD sequence, which is known 
      to be a cell attachment sequence; and a transmembrane region. The molecular mass 
      calculated from the amino acid sequence is 130 kDa, but that in the crude extract 
      was estimated by SDS-PAGE to be 230 kDa, and decreased to 130 kDa during 
      purification. However, when BglM1 was purified in the presence of calcium ion, the 
      molecular mass remained 230 kDa. The biochemical characteristics of the 130- and 
      230-kDa BglM1 forms were analyzed: differences were found in the kinetic data for 
      some substrates specific for both these enzymes; however, no difference was found in 
      their intrinsic characteristics such as optimum pH and temperature. In addition, the 
      molecular mass of native BglM1 with a calcium ion was estimated to be 1,000 kDa or 
      larger by gel filtration. These results suggest that the calcium ion influences the 
      conformation of BglM1. The evidence that BglM1 localizes on the plasma membrane of 
      plasmodia was confirmed using immunofluorescence microscopy. Although Physarum BglM1 
      was expressed in microplasmodia and plasmodia, little expression was detected in 
      other stages. BglM1 may have some function only in multinuclear cells.

AB  - We study how the net transport and mixing of chemicals occur in a relatively large 
      amoeba, the true slime mold Physarum polycephalum. The shuttle streaming of the 
      amoeba is characterized by a rhythmic flow of the order of 1 μm/s in which the 
      protoplasm streams back and forth. To explain the experimentally observed transport 
      of chemicals, we formulate a simplified model to consider the mechanism by which net 
      transport can be induced by shuttle (or periodic) motion inside the amoeba. This 
      model is independent from the details of fluid property as it is based on the mass 
      conservation law only. Even in such a simplified model, we demonstrate that 
      sectional oscillations play an important role in net transport and discuss the 
      effects of the sectional boundary motion on net transport in the microorganism.

TI  - A PSTAIRE CDK-like protein localizes in nuclei and cytoplasm of Physarum 
      polycephalum and functions in the mitosis.
PG  - 169-75
AB  - CDKs play key roles in controlling cell cycle progression in all eukaryotes. In 
      plants, multiple CDKs are present, among which the best characterized CDKs are 
      PSTAIRE CDKs. In this study, we carried out Western blot, immunoelectron microscopy 
      and antibody treatment with an anti-PSTAIRE monoclonal antibody to explore the 
      subcellular localization and functions of PSTAIRE CDKs in Physarum polycephalum. The 
      results of western blot and immunoelectron microscopy showed that in P. 
      polycephalum, a PSTAIRE CDK-like protein was 34 kD in molecular weight and located 
      in both nuclei and cytoplasm. In nuclei, the protein was mainly associated with 
      chromosomes and nucleoli. The expression of the PSTAIRE CDK-like protein in both the 
      plasmodia and nuclei showed little fluctuation through the whole cell cycle. When 
      treated with an anti-PSTAIRE monoclonal antibody at early S phase, the cells were 
      arrested in S phase, and the mitotic onset of P. polycephalum was blocked for about 
      1 h when treated at early G2 phase. Our data indicated that the PSTAIRE CDK- like 
      protein has a direct bearing on the mitosis.

TI  - Regulation of levels of actin threonine phosphorylation during life cycle of 
      Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 77-87
AB  - Under various environmental stresses, the true slime mold Physarum polycephalum 
      converts into dormant forms, such as microcysts, sclerotia, and spores, which can 
      survive in adverse environments for a considerable period of time. In 
      drought-induced sclerotia, actin is threonine phosphorylated, which blocks its 
      ability to polymerize into filaments. It is known that fragmin and actin-fragmin 
      kinase (AFK) mediate this phosphorylation event. In this work, we demonstrate that 
      high levels of actin threonine phosphorylation are also found in other dormant 
      cells, including microcysts and spores. As the threonine phosphorylation of actin in 
      microcysts and sclerotia were induced by drought stress but not by other stresses, 
      we suggest that drought stress is essential for actin phosphorylation in both cell 
      types. Although characteristic filamentous actin structures (dot- or rod-like 
      structures) were observed in microcysts, sclerotia, and spores, actin 
      phosphorylation was not required for the formation of these structures. Prior to the 
      formation of both microcysts and sclerotia, AFK mRNA expression was activated 
      transiently, whereas fragmin mRNA levels decreased. Our results suggest that drought 
      stress and AFK might be involved in the threonine phosphorylation of actin.

PG  - 22-7
AB  - How individuals deal with multiple conflicting demands is an important aspect of 
      foraging ecology, yet work on foraging behavior has typically neglected 
      neurologically simple organisms. Here we examine the impact of an abiotic risk 
      (light) and energetic status on the foraging decisions of a protist, the slime mold 
      Physarum polycephalum. We examined patch choice in a "non-risky" environment by 
      presenting starved and non-starved P. polycephalum amoebas with a choice between two 
      shaded food patches (one high quality, one low quality). We next examined patch 
      choice in the presence of a conflict between foraging risk (light exposure) and food 
      quality by presenting amoebas with a choice between a shaded, low-quality patch, and 
      a light-exposed, high-quality patch. When both patches were shaded, 100% of amoebas 
      selected the higher quality food patch, irrespective of food-quality differences or 
      the individual's energetic status. When light exposure and food quality conflicted, 
      amoebas selected the patch with the higher food quality when the quality difference 
      between the patches was high. When the quality difference between patches was small, 
      amoebas selected the shaded, lower quality patch.

      Bacteriol. 83:234-240. 1962.-Techniques for inducing sporulation of pure cultures of 
      Physarum polycephalum are described. Small plasmodia grown in agitated culture were 
      harvested, allowed to fuse into large plasmodia (1.3 g wet weight each), and, after 
      incubation in the dark on a salts medium, exposed to light for 2 hr. The ensuing 
      formation of sporangia containing spores was complete after 12 to 16 hr. The 
      obligatory conditions for sporulation are: (i) an optimal growth age occurring just 
      prior to the maximal growth of the organism and at a time when nutrients in the 
      medium are exhausted; (ii) 4 days of incubation on a medium containing only 
      inorganic salts and niacin or tryptophan; and (iii) subsequent illumination with 
      light of wavelengths between 350 and 500 mmu.

TI  - Early zygote-specific nuclease in mitochondria of the true slime mold Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 334-43
AB  - The active, selective digestion of mtDNA from one parent is a possible molecular 
      mechanism for the uniparental inheritance of mtDNA. In Physarum polycephalum, mtDNA 
      is packed by DNA-binding protein Glom, which packs mtDNA into rod-shaped 
      mt-nucleoids. After the mating, mtDNA from one parent is selectively digested, and 
      the Glom began to disperse. Dispersed Glom was retained for at least 6 h after mtDNA 
      digestion, but disappeared completely by about 12 h after mixing two strains. We 
      identified two novel nucleases using DNA zymography with native-PAGE and SDS-PAGE. 
      One is a Ca2+-dependent, high-molecular-weight nuclease complex (about 670 kDa), and 
      the other is a Mn2+-dependent, high-molecular-weight nuclease complex (440-670 kDa); 
      the activity of the latter was detected as a Mn2+-dependent, 13-kDa DNase band on 
      SDS-PAGE. All mitochondria isolated from myxamoebae had mt-nucleoids, whereas half 
      of the mitochondria isolated from the zygotes at 12 h after mixing had lost the 
      mt-nucleoids. The activity of the Mn2+-dependent nuclease in the isolated 
      mitochondria was detected at least 8 h after mixing of two strains. The timing and 
      localization of the Mn2+-dependent DNase activity matched the selective digestion of 
      mtDNA.

TI  - The P1 and P1' residue specificities of physarolisin I, a serine-carboxyl peptidase 
      from the true slime mold Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 1168-71
AB  - The P1 and P1' residue specificities of physarolisin I were investigated using 
      combinatorial peptide substrates. The results indicated that certain hydrophobic 
      residues and acidic residues are preferred at the P1 position and some hydrophobic 
      residues at the P1' position. This P1 specificity, different from other 
      serine-carboxyl peptidases, appears to be explained partially by the nature of the 
      S1 subsite residues.

TI  - Spatial transcriptomic and single-nucleus analysis reveals heterogeneity in a 
      gigantic single-celled syncytium.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.69745 [doi]
LID - e69745
AB  - In multicellular organisms, the specification, coordination, and 
      compartmentalization of cell types enable the formation of complex body plans. 
      However, some eukaryotic protists such as slime molds generate diverse and complex 
      structures while remaining in a multinucleate syncytial state. It is unknown if 
      different regions of these giant syncytial cells have distinct transcriptional 
      responses to environmental encounters and if nuclei within the cell diversify into 
      heterogeneous states. Here, we performed spatial transcriptome analysis of the slime 
      mold Physarum polycephalum in the plasmodium state under different environmental 
      conditions and used single-nucleus RNA-sequencing to dissect gene expression 
      heterogeneity among nuclei. Our data identifies transcriptome regionality in the 
      organism that associates with proliferation, syncytial substructures, and localized 
      environmental conditions. Further, we find that nuclei are heterogenous in their 
      transcriptional profile and may process local signals within the plasmodium to 
      coordinate cell growth, metabolism, and reproduction. To understand how nuclei 
      variation within the syncytium compares to heterogeneity in single-nucleus cells, we 
      analyzed states in single Physarum amoebal cells. We observed amoebal cell states at 
      different stages of mitosis and meiosis, and identified cytokinetic features that 
      are specific to nuclei divisions within the syncytium. Notably, we do not find 
      evidence for predefined transcriptomic states in the amoebae that are observed in 
      the syncytium. Our data shows that a single-celled slime mold can control its gene 
      expression in a region-specific manner while lacking cellular compartmentalization 
      and suggests that nuclei are mobile processors facilitating local specialized 
      functions. More broadly, slime molds offer the extraordinary opportunity to explore 
      how organisms can evolve regulatory mechanisms to divide labor, specialize, balance 
      competition with cooperation, and perform other foundational principles that govern 
      the logic of life.

TI  - Analyses of expression and localization of two mammalian-type transglutaminases in 
      Physarum polycephalum, an acellular slime mold.
PG  - 665-72
AB  - Transglutaminase (TGase) is an enzyme that modifies proteins by crosslinking or 
      polyamination. Physarum polycephalum, an acellular slime mold, is the evolutionally 
      lowest organism that has a mammalian-type transglutaminase. We have cloned a cDNA 
      for Physarum polycephalum TGase (PpTGB), homologous to a previously identified TGase 
      (PpTGA), whose sequence is similar to that of mammalian TGases. PpTGB encodes a 
      primary sequence identical to that of PpTGA except for 11 amino acid residues at the 
      N-terminus. Reverse transcription-PCR and Western blotting analyses showed that both 
      PpTGA and PpTGB are expressed in microplasmodia and macroplasmodia during their life 
      cycle, except for in sporangia. For biochemical characterization, we carried out the 
      ectopical expressions of PpTGA and PpTGB in Dictyostelium discoideum. Subcellular 
      fractionation of these Dictyostelium cells showed that the expressed PpTGA, but not 
      PpTGB, localizes to the membrane fraction. Furthermore, in Physarum, subcellular 
      fractionation and immunostaining indicated specific localization at the plasma 
      membrane in macroplasmodia, while the localization was entirely cytoplasmic in 
      microplasmodia.

PG  - 349-65
AB  - We reconstruct the regulatory network controlling commitment and sporulation of 
      Physarum polycephalum from experimental results using a hierarchical Petri Net-based 
      modelling and simulation framework. The stochastic Petri Net consistently describes 
      the structure and simulates the dynamics of the molecular network as analysed by 
      genetic, biochemical and physiological experiments within a single coherent model. 
      The Petri Net then is extended to simulate time-resolved somatic complementation 
      experiments performed by mixing the cytoplasms of mutants altered in the sporulation 
      response, to systematically explore the network structure and to probe its dynamics. 
      This reverse engineering approach presumably can be employed to explore other 
      molecular or genetic signalling systems where the activity of genes or their 
      products can be experimentally controlled in a time-resolved manner.

AB  - Cells are dynamic systems capable of switching from isotropic growth to polarized 
      growth even in the absence of any pre-existing external asymmetry. Here, we study 
      this process of symmetry breaking in the acellular slime mould Physarum 
      polycephalum. In these experiments, slime moulds could grow on two identical opposed 
      sources of calcium. We highlighted a positive correlation between growth dynamic, 
      level of symmetry breaking and calcium concentration. We identified three 
      populations of slime moulds within our clonal lineage with similar symmetry breaking 
      behaviours but different motility characteristics. These behavioural differences 
      between slime moulds emerged in the absence of any environmental differences. Such 
      behavioural plasticity could generate cellular diversity, which can be critical for 
      survival.

AB  - Post-transcriptional insertion, substitution or deletion of nucleotides in RNA (RNA

      ribosome of Physarum polycephalum is edited at 40 sites with single cytidine 
      insertions. The locations of the editing sites are fairly evenly distributed 
      throughout the RNA and do not correspond to any obvious feature of the primary 
      sequence or secondary structure. In addition to these cytidine editing sites are 
      editing sites in which a nucleotide other than cytidine is inserted. At two sites a 
      uridine is inserted and at two sites adenosine residues are inserted. This is the 
      first report of mixed nucleotide insertional editing. These results imply that the 
      editing mechanism in Physarum may be different from those proposed for the 
      kinetoplastid protozoa.

PG  - 136-48
AB  - The giant syncytium of Physarum plasmodia possesses a complex cytoplasmic 
      microtubule network except during the occurrence of the intranuclear mitosis. In 
      early prophase stages, intranuclear spindles assemble concomitantly as the 
      cytoplasmic microtubule network disassembles. No cytoplasmic microtubules are 
      present in metaphase. They begin to reassemble in telophase. The complex cytoplasmic 
      microtubule network reappears in early reconstruction stages. The assembly of 
      cytoplasmic microtubules occurs on cytoplasmic foci, both in telophase stage and 
      during rewarming after cold microtubule disassembly. These foci, independent of the 
      nuclei, correspond to the foci observed in the cytoplasm during interphase, both by 
      immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. As cytoplasmic and intranuclear 
      microtubule-organizing centers are spatially distinct, plasmodial syncytia offer the 
      possibility to study the effects of cell regulatory pathways on two types of 
      microtubule-organizing centers that differ in their nucleating activity during the 
      cell cycle.

      from the cDNA sequence and involvement of GTP in the regulation of transamidating 
      activity.
PG  - 3451-60
AB  - Transglutaminase (TGase) catalyses the post-translational modification of proteins 
      by transamidation of available glutamine residues. While several TGase genes of fish 
      and arthropods have been cloned and appear to have similar structures to those of 
      mammals, no homologous gene has been found in lower eukaryotes. We have cloned the 
      acellular slime mold Physarum polycephalum TGase cDNA using RT-PCR with degenerated 
      primers, based on the partial amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme. The cDNA 
      contained a 2565-bp ORF encoding a 855-residue polypeptide. By Northern blotting, an 
      mRNA of approximately 2600 bases was detected. In comparison with primary sequences 
      of mammalian TGases, surprisingly, significant similarity was observed including 
      catalytic triad residues (Cys, His, Asn) and a GTP-binding region. The alignment of 
      sequences and a phylogenetic tree also demonstrated that the structure of P. 
      polycephalum TGase is similar to that of TGases of vertebrates. Furthermore, we 
      observed that the purified TGase had GTP-hydrolysing activity and that GTP inhibited 
      its transamidating activity, as in the case of mammalian tissue-type TGase (TGase 
      2).

TI  - Genomic structure of two ras family genes in the slime mold Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 231-6
AB  - Genomic structure of two Physarum polycephalum ras family genes, Ppras2 and Pprap1, 
      has been determined, including the upstream region of the latter. The genes are 
      interrupted by three and four introns, respectively. The first intron of Ppras2 has 
      the same location within the coding sequence as the first intron in another ras 
      homolog from this organism, Ppras1 [Trzcińska-Danielewicz, J., Kozlowski, P., and 
      Toczko, K. (1996). "Cloning and genomic sequence of the Physarum polycephalum Ppras1 
      gene, a homologue of the ras protooncogene", Gene 169, pp. 143-144]. All introns, 
      ranging from 53 to ca. 460 base pairs, have the canonical 5' and 3' ends, are 
      greatly enriched in pyrimidines in the coding strand and have frequent 
      pyrimidines-only tracts. These latter features seem to be responsible for the 
      difficulties in cloning and sequencing of parts of these genes. Short sequences 
      shared with P. polycephalum transposon-like repeats are common in the introns, 
      indicating a possible role of transposition in intron evolution. In all three ras 
      family genes phase zero introns are located mostly between sequences coding for 
      regular protein secondary structure elements.

TI  - RNA editing of 10 Didymium iridis mitochondrial genes and comparison with the 
      homologous genes in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 828-38
LID - 10.1261/rna.1989310 [doi]
AB  - Regions of the Didymium iridis mitochondrial genome were identified with similarity 
      to typical mitochondrial genes; however, these regions contained numerous stop 
      codons. We used RT-PCR and DNA sequencing to determine whether, through RNA editing, 
      these regions were transcribed into mRNAs that could encode functional proteins. Ten 
      putative gene regions were examined: atp1, atp6, atp8, atp9, cox1, cox2, cytb, 
      nad4L, nad6, and nad7. The cDNA sequences of each gene could encode a functional 
      mitochondrial protein that was highly conserved compared with homologous genes. The 
      type of editing events and editing sequence features were very similar to those 
      observed in the homologous genes of Physarum polycephalum, though the actual editing 
      locations showed a variable degree of conservation. Edited sites were compared with 
      encoded sites in D. iridis and P. polycephalum for all 10 genes. Edited sequence for 
      a portion of the cox1 gene was available for six myxomycetes, which, when compared, 
      showed a high degree of conservation at the protein level. Different types of 
      editing events showed varying degrees of site conservation with C-to-U base changes 
      being the least conserved. Several aspects of single C insertion editing events led 
      to the preferential creation of hydrophobic amino acid codons that may help to 
      minimize adverse effects on the resulting protein structure.

TI  - Nitric oxide synthase is induced in sporulation of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 1299-309
AB  - The myxomycete Physarum polycephalum expresses a calcium-independent nitric oxide 
      (NO) synthase (NOS) resembling the inducible NOS isoenzyme in mammals. We have now 
      cloned and sequenced this, the first nonanimal NOS to be identified, showing that it 
      shares < 39% amino acid identity with known NOSs but contains conserved binding 
      motifs for all NOS cofactors. It lacks the sequence insert responsible for calcium 
      dependence in the calcium-dependent NOS isoenzymes. NOS expression was strongly 
      up-regulated in Physarum macroplasmodia during the 5-day starvation period needed to 
      induce sporulation competence. Induction of both NOS and sporulation competence were 
      inhibited by glucose, a growth signal and known repressor of sporulation, and by 
      L-N6-(1-iminoethyl)-lysine (NIL), an inhibitor of inducible NOS. Sporulation, which 
      is triggered after the starvation period by light exposure, was also prevented by 
      1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo-[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ), an inhibitor of NO-sensitive 
      guanylate cyclase. In addition, also expression of lig1, a sporulation-specific 
      gene, was strongly attenuated by NIL or ODQ. 8-Bromo-cGMP, added 2 h before the 
      light exposure, restored the capacity of NIL-treated macroplasmodia to express lig1 
      and to sporulate. This indicates that the second messenger used for NO signaling in 
      sporulation of Physarum is cGMP and links this signaling pathway to expression of 
      lig1.

AB  - Unicellular organisms live in unpredictable environments. Therefore, they need to 
      continuously assess environmental conditions and respond appropriately to survive 
      and thrive. When subjected to rapid changes in their environment or to cellular 
      damages, unicellular organisms such as bacteria exhibit strong physiological 
      reactions called stress responses that can be sensed by conspecifics. The ability to 
      detect and use stress-related cues released by conspecifics to acquire information 
      about the environment constitutes an adaptive survival response by prompting the 
      organism to avoid potential dangers. Here, we investigate stress signalling and its 
      detection by conspecifics in a unicellular organism, Physarum polycephalum. Slime 
      moulds were subjected to either biotic (i.e. nutritional) or abiotic (i.e. chemical 
      and light) stressors or left undisturbed while they were exploring a homogeneous 
      environment. Then, we observed the responses of slime moulds facing a choice between 
      cues released by stressed clone mates and cues released by undisturbed ones. We 
      found that slime moulds actively avoided environments previously explored by 
      stressed clone mates. These results suggest that slime moulds, like bacteria or 
      social amoeba, exhibit physiological responses to biotic and abiotic stresses that 
      can be sensed by conspecifics. Our results establish slime moulds as a promising new 
      model to investigate the use of social information in unicellular organisms. This 
      article is part of the theme issue 'Signal detection theory in recognition systems: 
      from evolving models to experimental tests'.

TI  - Replicational organization of three weakly expressed loci in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 2261-9
AB  - We previously mapped early-activated replication origins in the promoter regions of 
      five abundantly transcribed genes in the slime mold Physarum polycephalum. This 
      physical linkage between origins and genes is congruent with the preferential early 
      replication of the active genes in mammalian cells. To determine how general this 
      replicational organization is in the synchronous plasmodium of Physarum, we analyzed 
      the replication of three weakly expressed genes. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) 
      density-shift and gene dosage experiments indicated that the redB (regulated in 
      development) and redE genes replicate early, whereas redA replicates in mid-S phase. 
      Bi-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed that redA coincides with an origin that 
      appears to be activated within a large temporal window in S phase so that the 
      replication of the gene is not well defined temporally. The early replication of the 
      redB and redE genes is due to the simultaneous activation of flanking origins at the 
      onset of S phase. As a result, these two genes correspond to termination sites of 
      DNA replication. Our data demonstrate that not all the Physarum promoters are 
      preferred sites of initiation but, so far, all the expressed genes analyzed in 
      detail either coincide with a replication origin or are embedded into a cluster of 
      early firing replicons.

TI  - Structure and properties of the recombinant NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase of Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 783-90
AB  - A cDNA for NADH-cytochrome b(5) reductase of Physarum polycephalum was cloned from a 
      cDNA library, and the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA was determined (accession no. 
      AB259870). The DNA of 943 base pairs contains 5'- and 3'-noncoding sequences, 
      including a polyadenylation sequence, and a coding sequence of 843 base pairs. The 
      amino acid sequence (281 residues) deduced from the nucleotide sequence was 25 
      residues shorter than those of vertebrate enzymes. Nevertheless, the recombinant 
      Physarum enzyme showed enzyme activity comparable to that of the human enzyme. The 
      recombinant Physarum enzyme showed a pH optimum of around 6.0, and apparent K(m) 
      values of 2 microM and 14 microM for NADH and cytochrome b(5) respectively. The 
      purified recombinant enzyme showed a typical FAD-derived absorption peak of 
      cytochrome b(5) reductase at around 460 nm, with a shoulder at 480 nm. These results 
      suggest that the Physarum enzyme plays an important role in the organism.

TI  - Estimating the number of plasmids taken up by a eukaryotic cell during transfection 
      and evidence that antisense RNA abolishes gene expression in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 29-35
AB  - We have estimated the statistical distribution of the number of plasmids taken up by 
      individual Jurkat lymphoma cells during electroporation in the presence of two 
      plasmids, one encoding for yellow (EYFP) the other for cyan (ECFP) fluorescent 
      protein. The plasmid concentration at which most of the cells take up only one 
      plasmid or several molecules was determined by statistical analysis. We found that 
      cells behaved slightly heterogeneous in plasmid uptake and describe how the 
      homogeneity of a cell population can be quantified by Poisson statistics in order to 
      identify experimental conditions that yield homogeneously transfection-competent 
      cell populations. The experimental procedure worked out with Jurkat cells was 
      applied to assay the effectiveness of antisense RNA in knocking down gene expression 
      in Physarum polycephalum. Double transfection of flagellates with vectors encoding 
      EYFP and antisense-EYFP revealed for the first time that gene expression can be 
      suppressed by co-expression of antisense RNA in Physarum. Quantitative analysis 
      revealed that one copy of antisense expressing gene per EYFP gene was sufficient to 
      completely suppress formation of the EYFP protein in Physarum.

TI  - Stage specific expression of poly(malic acid)-affiliated genes in the life cycle of 
      Physarum polycephalum. Spherulin 3b and polymalatase.
PG  - 1046-55
AB  - Polymalic acid is receiving interest as a unique biopolymer of the plasmodia of 
      mycetozoa and recently as a biogenic matrix for the synthesis of devices for drug 
      delivery. The acellular slime mold Physarum polycephalum is characterized by two 
      distinctive growth phases: uninucleated amoebae and multinucleated plasmodia. In 
      adverse conditions, plasmodia reversibly transform into spherules. Only plasmodia 
      synthesize poly(malic acid) (PMLA) and PMLA-hydrolase (polymalatase). We have 
      performed suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) of cDNA from amoebae and 
      plasmodia to identify plasmodium-specific genes involved in PMLA metabolism. We 
      found cDNA encoding a plasmodium-specific, spherulin 3a-like polypeptide, NKA48 
      (spherulin 3b), but no evidence for a PMLA-synthetase encoding transcript. 
      Inhibitory RNA (RNAi)-induced knockdown of NKA48-cDNA generated a severe reduction 
      in the level of PMLA suggesting that spherulin 3b functioned in regulating the level 
      of PMLA. Unexpectedly, cDNA of polymalatase was not SSH-selected, suggesting its 
      presence also in amoebae. Quantitative PCR then revealed low levels of mRNA in 
      amoebae, high levels in plasmodia, and also low levels in spherules, in agreement 
      with the expression under transcriptional regulation in these cells.

TI  - Localization by high resolution in situ hybridization of the ribosomal 
      minichromosomes during the nucleolar cycle of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 354-64
AB  - We have used biotinylated rDNA probes to localize by in situ hybridization the 
      extrachromosomal genes for ribosomal RNA in the slime mold Physarum polycephalum. We 
      established conditions that allow for highly specific hybridization at the 
      ultrastructural level and determined that the 60-kb palindromic rDNA molecules are 
      confined to the nucleolus in interphase. Our study definitively locates these 
      extrachromosomal genes in mitosis in the form of thin DNA fibers contained within 
      nucleolar remnants. We further show that these rDNA minichromosomes do not condense 
      and that they segregate as entities independent of the condensed chromosomal DNA. In 
      telophase, these minichromosomes migrate from the poles toward the equatorial region 
      of the nucleus in a direction opposite that of the chromosomes. Our results 
      illustrate the discontinuous nature of the nucleolar organizing region in Physarum.

TI  - Requirements for self-splicing of a group I intron from Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 4315-20
AB  - The third intron from Physarum polycephalum (Pp LSU 3) is one of the closest known 
      relatives to the well-studied Tetrahymena group I intron. Both introns are located 
      at the same position in the 26S rRNA gene, and with the exception of an open reading 
      frame in Pp LSU 3, are highly homologous. While Pp LSU 3 has been shown to self 
      splice, little is known about its activity in vitro. We have examined the 
      requirements for self splicing in greater detail. Despite its similarity to the 
      Tetrahymena intron, Pp LSU 3 is 1500-fold less reactive, demonstrates a preference 
      for high salt, and exhibits a low Km for GTP. Removal of the open reading frame 
      results in a modest increase of activity. This system provides an opportunity to 
      understand how sequence variations in two related introns alter the efficiency of 
      autoexcision, and how this relates to adaptation of group I introns to their 
      particular sequence context.

AB  - Although machines may be good at mimicking, they are not currently able, as 
      organisms are, to act creatively. We offer an understanding of the emergent 
      qualities of biological sign processing in terms of generalization, association, and 
      encryption. We use slime mold as a model of minimal cognition and compare it to 
      deep-learning video game bots, which some claim have evolved beyond their merely 
      quantitative algorithms. We find that these discrete Turing machine bots are not 
      able to make productive, yet unanticipated, "errors"-necessary for biological 
      learning-which, based on the physicality of signs, their relatively similar shapes, 
      and relative physical positions spatially and temporally, lead to emergent effects 
      and make learning and evolution possible. In organisms, stochastic resonance at the 
      local level can be leveraged for self-organization at the global level. We contrast 
      all this to the symbolic processing of today's machine learning, whereby each logic 
      node and memory state is discrete. Computer codes are produced by external 
      operators, whereas biological symbols are evolved through an internal encryption 
      process.

      requirement for sporulation of Physarum polycephalum. J. Bacteriol. 83:1244-1250. 
      1962.-The myxomycete Physarum polycephalum undergoes sexual sporulation if exposed 
      to light after 4 days of incubation in the dark on a salts medium containing niacin, 
      niacinamide, or tryptophan. None of these compounds is required for growth. Quinic 
      acid, shikimic acid, intermediates of the kynurenine pathway, diphosphopyridine 
      nucleotide (DPN), and triphosphopyridine nucleotide (TPN) replace niacin but a 
      number of other tryptophan metabolites do not. Analogues of niacin inhibit 
      sporulation when added at the beginning but not at the end of dark incubation with 
      niacin. Folic acid, p-aminobenzoic acid, and p-aminobenzenesulfonamide inhibit 
      sporulation if added at any time during the incubation or illumination periods. 
      Reduced di- or triphosphopyridine nucleotide, but not DPN or TPN, reverse the 
      p-aminobenzoic acid inhibition but do not replace the light requirement or shorten 
      the dark incubation period. Gluconate and 2-ketogluconate also replace niacin. 
      Glucose, pyruvate, malate, and oxalacetate inhibit the niacin-induced sporulation. 
      Iodoacetate and fluoride do not counteract the glucose effect or inhibit 
      sporulation.

TI  - Molecular constituents of the replication apparatus in the plasmodium of Physarum 
      polycephalum: identification by photoaffinity labelling.
PG  - 3181-3193
LID - 10.1099/00221287-144-11-3181 [doi]
AB  - The plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum has long been considered a model system for 
      syncytically growing cells, but important details of the DNA replication apparatus, 
      such as the DNA polymerase epsilon and other replication factors, have not been 
      detected. In this study, a new variation of photoaffinity labelling and 
      immunoblotting was used to detect DNA polymerases and other factors in nuclear 
      extracts of P. polycaphalum. Proteins were specifically cross-linked with 
      photoreactive arylazido-dCMP residues incorporated during extension of 
      template-primer DNA. The DNA synthesized in situ was 32P-labelled. After nucleolytic 
      removal of protruding DNA, the proteins were separated by SDS-gel electrophoresis, 
      electroblotted on membranes and subjected to autoradiography. The alpha, delta, 
      epsilon and beta-like DNA polymerases were labelled, as were histones and 
      replication-factor-like proteins. Cytoplasmic extracts were devoid of these species. 
      Abundant proliferating-cell nuclear antigen and replication protein A large subunit 
      were labelled and found to be of unusual mass. A number of subunits of purified DNA 
      polymerase holoenzymes were labelled. In contrast, only the DNA-polymerizing 
      subunits could be labelled in nuclear extracts. Higher-order complexes in the 
      nuclear extract may make subunits inaccessible to photo-cross-linking. Complex 
      formation is promoted by beta-poly(L-malate), a plasmodium-specific putative storage 
      and carrier molecule that supports DNA replication in the synchronized nuclei. 
      Percoll, a polyvinylpyrrolidone-coated colloidal silica, partially disrupted these 
      complexes. A 200 kDa fragment of DNA polymerase epsilon and a 135 kDa beta-like DNA 
      polymerase did not participate in the complexes, suggesting functions unlike those 
      of the other polymerases. DNA polymerase molecules were intact during proliferation 
      of plasmodia, but were nicked before their clearance from the nuclei at growth 
      arrest.

AB  - A cDNA library from amoebae of Physarum polycephalum was screened by differential 
      hybridization. Two clones contained inserts for mRNAs present in amoebae and absent 
      in plasmodia. The LAV3-4 cDNA encodes a 402 aa protein (ABP-46) that shows sequence 
      similarity to the actin binding site in the N-terminal region of the alpha-actinin 
      family. The LAV3-5 cDNA is 76% identical to the Dictyostelium actin bundling 
      protein, which cross-links and stabilizes actin filaments in amoebal filopodia.

AB  - A living coupled oscillator system was constructed by a cell patterning method with 
      a plasmodial slime mold, in which parameters such as coupling strength and distance 
      between the oscillators can be systematically controlled. Rich oscillation phenomena 
      between the two-coupled oscillators, namely, desynchronizing and antiphase/in-phase 
      synchronization were observed according to these parameters. Both experimental and 
      theoretical approaches showed that these phenomena are closely related to the time 
      delay effect in interactions between the oscillators.

      Sievert, and Harold P. Rusch. Organic requirements and synthetic media for growth of 
      the myxomycete Physarum polycephalum. J. Bacteriol. 86:324-331. 1963.-An isolate of 
      Physarum polycephalum was maintained in submersed pure culture in a completely 
      defined medium, giving cell yields approximately 70% of those obtained in a 
      partially defined medium. Optimal concentrations of the absolute organic 
      requirements, identified as d- or l-methionine, biotin, thiamine, and hematin as 
      previously reported, were established. Glycine was highly stimulatory. In a minimal 
      medium, alanine or glutamine, not required in the complete medium, stimulated growth 
      and appeared to function as sources for transamination. Arginine was also required 
      in the minimal medium. The cell yield in a simplified medium containing the absolute 
      requirements plus glycine, alanine, and arginine was approximately the same as that 
      in the complete medium, but the growth rate was about 25% lower.

TI  - Mitotic segregation of the nucleolar ribosomal RNA in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 509-17
AB  - In the naturally synchronous mitosis of the syncytial plasmodium of Physarum 
      polycephalum, the nucleolus disintegrates in prophase, releasing a large amount of 
      ribosomal RNA. Using biotinylated rDNA probes, we studied by high-resolution in situ 
      hybridization the behavior of this nucleolar RNA throughout mitosis. Our results 
      demonstrate that this rRNA is stable and maintained within the mitotic nucleus 
      mainly, but not exclusively, associated with fibrillar nucleolar remnants. The 
      distribution of these rRNA molecules on both sides of the cleavage plane in 
      telophase is indicative of a precise mechanism of mitotic partition of the nucleolar 
      components, supporting our recent findings concerning the rDNA minichromosomes 
      (Puvion-Dutilleul and Pierron, 1992, Exp. Cell Res. 203, 354-364). Taking advantage 
      of the stability of this RNA component in mitosis, we unambiguously demonstrate that 
      the nucleolar remnants are the precursors of the prenucleolar bodies appearing in 
      the newly divided nuclei which, by fusion, reconstitute a single nucleolus. Our data 
      exemplify the persistence of the nucleolar rRNA in mitosis and demonstrate that in 
      Physarum, following its disintegration, the nucleolus is segregated and inherited.

TI  - Sampling gene diversity across the supergroup Amoebozoa: large EST data sets from 
      Acanthamoeba castellanii, Hartmannella vermiformis, Physarum polycephalum, 
      Hyperamoeba dachnaya and Hyperamoeba sp.

AB  - From comparative analysis of EST data for five taxa within the eukaryotic supergroup 
      Amoebozoa, including two free-living amoebae (Acanthamoeba castellanii, Hartmannella 
      vermiformis) and three slime molds (Physarum polycephalum, Hyperamoeba dachnaya and 
      Hyperamoeba sp.), we obtained new broad-range perspectives on the evolution and 
      biosynthetic capacity of this assemblage. Together with genome sequences for the 
      amoebozoans Dictyostelium discoideum and Entamoeba histolytica, and including 
      partial genome sequence available for A. castellanii, we used the EST data to 
      identify genes that appear to be exclusive to the supergroup, and to specific clades 
      therein. Many of these genes are likely involved in cell-cell communication or 
      differentiation. In examining on a broad scale a number of characters that 
      previously have been considered in simpler cross-species comparisons, typically 
      between Dictyostelium and Entamoeba, we find that Amoebozoa as a whole exhibits 
      striking variation in the number and distribution of biosynthetic pathways, for 
      example, ones for certain critical stress-response molecules, including trehalose 
      and mannitol. Finally, we report additional compelling cases of lateral gene 
      transfer within Amoebozoa, further emphasizing that although this process has 
      influenced genome evolution in all examined amoebozoan taxa, it has done so to a 
      variable extent.

TI  - Identification of three genes expressed primarily during development in Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 364-76
AB  - During the life cycle of Physarum polycephalum, uninucleate amoebae develop into 
      multinucleate syncytial plasmodia. These two cell types differ greatly in cellular 
      organisation, behaviour and gene expression. Classical genetic analysis has 
      identified the mating-type gene, matA, as the key gene controlling the initiation of 
      plasmodium development, but nothing is known about the molecular events controlled 
      by matA. In order to identify genes involved in regulating plasmodium formation, we 
      constructed a subtracted cDNA library from cells undergoing development. Three genes 
      that have their highest levels of expression during plasmodium development were 
      identified: redA, redB (regulated in development) and mynD (myosin). Both redA and 
      redB are single-copy genes and are not members of gene families. Although redA has 
      no significant sequence similarities to known genes, redB has sequence similarity to 
      invertebrate sarcoplasmic calcium-binding proteins. The mynD gene is closely related 
      to type II myosin heavy-chain genes from many organisms and is one of a family of 
      type II myosin genes in P. polycephalum. Our results indicate that many more red 
      genes remain to be identified, some of which may play key roles in controlling 
      plasmodium formation.

PG  - 533-8
AB  - Protein kinase activities in myxoamoebae of a true slime mold, Physarum 
      polycephalum, were investigated in response to heat shock. In-gel assay detected an 
      apparent activation of a Ca(2+)-dependent, 53-kDa protein kinase that phosphorylated 
      casein but not histone H1. This enzyme needed co-presence of Mg2+ ion with Ca2+ for 
      activity. Treatment with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase did not affect the 
      heat-inducible 53-kDa protein kinase activity at all. The effects of protein kinase 
      inhibitors were examined, and staurosporine suppressed the activity of this enzyme 
      completely. H-7 decreased the activity to about 20% and HA-1004 to 65%. These 
      results suggest that this protein kinase that may phosphorylate tyrosine and 
      serine/threonine residues of target proteins is activated by heat shock in Physarum 
      cells, and the activation is not regulated via phosphorylation by putative protein 
      kinase(s) that may act at an upstream position in the signaling cascade(s).

TI  - Action spectrum for sporulation and photoavoidance in the plasmodium of Physarum 
      polycephalum, as modified differentially by temperature and starvation.
PG  - 859-62
AB  - The plasmodium of the myxomycete Physarum polycephalum sporulates in bright natural 
      environments, suggesting a relationship between photobehavior and sporulation. Thus, 
      the action spectra for two light-dependent phenomena as well as the effects of other 
      environmental conditions have been studied. Sporulation like photo-avoidance 
      responded to UVC (near 270 nm) and near IR (near 750 nm) in addition to the 
      well-documented UVA (near 350 nm) and blue (near 460 nm) regions. Sporulation and 
      photoavoidance had similar sensitivities in the shorter wavelengths, while the 
      former was about 100 times more sensitive in near IR. The plasmodium moved away from 
      light in a wide spectral range. Starvation and high temperature at 31 degrees C (25 
      degrees C in standard conditions) reduced photoavoidance to UVA and to blue light, 
      respectively. A high fluence rate of UVC suppressed the rhythmic contraction of the 
      plasmodium, and the action spectrum peaked at 270 nm. These results indicate that 
      the Physarum plasmodium may stay at brighter places not by positive phototaxis but 
      by weakening the negative phototaxis to sunlight or by other possible taxes such as 
      hydrotaxis. There may be at least four different photo-systems in the plasmodium.

TI  - Allometry in Physarum plasmodium during free locomotion: size versus shape, speed 
      and rhythm.
PG  - 3729-38
LID - 10.1242/jeb.124354 [doi]
AB  - Physarum plasmodium is a giant unicellular organism whose length can vary by more 
      than three orders of magnitude. Using plasmodia ranging in size from 100 μm to 
      10 cm, we investigated the size dependency of their thickness distributions and 
      locomotion speeds during free locomotion. (1) In the longitudinal direction, the 
      organism is thickest close to the front, and decreases exponentially in thickness 
      towards the rear. The slenderness ratio varies with body size according to a power 
      law, such that large plasmodia are long and flat, whereas small plasmodia are short 
      and thick. (2) The mean locomotion speed is proportional to the mean maximum 
      thickness of the frontal part. By conducting a dimensional analysis, possible 
      physical models are discussed. (3) The intrinsic period of the thickness 
      oscillation, which is related to shuttle streaming (period 1-2 min), increases 
      logarithmically with body size. (4) Various characteristics exhibit 
      size-independent, long-period (20±10 min) oscillations, including speed, shape and 
      intrinsic thickness oscillation period. These variations are closely coupled to 
      formation of the entire cell shape, including undulation of thickness along the 
      longitudinal axis and timing of branching of the frontal tip. Based on these 
      experimental results and those reported previously, we propose a simple mathematical 
      model for cell locomotion.

TI  - A genetic system controlling mitochondrial fusion in the slime mould, Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 213-24
AB  - We have identified two distinct mitochondrial phenotypes, namely, Mif+ 
      (mitochondrial fusion) and Mif- (mitochondrial fusion-deficient), and have studied 
      the genetic system that controls mitochondrial fusion in the slime mould, Physarum 
      polycephalum. A mitochondrial plasmid of approximately 16 kbp was identified in all 
      Mif+ plasmodial strains. This plasmid is apparently responsible for promoting 
      mitochondrial fusion, and it is inserted into the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in 
      successive sexual crossing with Mif- strains. This recombinant mtDNA and the 
      unchanged free plasmid spread through the mitochondrial population via the promotion 
      of mitochondrial fusion. The Mif+ strains with the plasmid were further classified 
      as being two types: high frequency and low frequency mitochondrial fusion. 
      Restriction analysis of the mtDNA suggested that the high frequency mitochondrial 
      fusion type was more often heteroplasmic; within each plasmodium, mtDNAs of both 
      parental types were usually present, in addition to the presence of the plasmid. 
      Genetic analysis with the progeny obtained from crossing myxamoebae derived from 
      three different isolates suggested that these progeny carried different alleles at a 
      nuclear locus that controlled the frequency of mitochondrial fusion. These alleles 
      (mitochondrial mating-type alleles, mitA1, 2 and 3) appear to function like the 
      mating type of the myxamoebae; mitochondrial fusion occurs at high frequency with 
      the combination of unlike alleles, but at low frequency with the combination of like 
      alleles.

TI  - A mobile group I intron from Physarum polycephalum can insert itself and induce 
      point mutations in the nuclear ribosomal DNA of saccharomyces cerevisiae.
PG  - 1023-33
AB  - Pp LSU3 is a mobile group I intron in the extrachromosomal nuclear ribosomal DNA 
      (rDNA) of Physarum polycephalum. As found for other mobile introns, Pp LSU3 encodes 
      a site-specific endonuclease, I-Ppo, which mediates "homing" to unoccupied target 
      sites in Physarum rDNA. The recognition sequence for this enzyme is conserved in all 
      eucaryotic nuclear rDNAs. We have introduced this intron into a heterologous 
      species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in which nuclear group I introns have not been 
      detected. The expression of Pp LSU3, under control of the inducible GAL10 promoter, 
      was found to be lethal as a consequence of double-strand breaks in the rDNA. 
      However, surviving colonies that are resistant to the lethal effects of I-Ppo 
      because of alterations in the rDNA at the cleavage site were recovered readily. 
      These survivors are of two classes. The first comprises cells that acquired one of 
      three types of point mutations. The second comprises cells in which Pp LSU3 became 
      inserted into the rDNA. In both cases, each resistant survivor appears to carry the 
      same alterations in all approximately 150 rDNA repeats. When it is embedded in yeast 
      rDNA, Pp LSU3 leads to the synthesis of I-Ppo and appears to be mobile in 
      appropriate genetic crosses. The existence of yeast cells carrying a mobile intron 
      should allow dissection of the steps that allow expression of the highly unusual 
      I-Ppo gene.

TI  - [Immunochemical identification of kinesin in Physarum polycephalum].
PG  - 164-7
AB  - Physarum polycephalum, a low eukaryote ameba provides an attractive system for 
      studying contractile proteins. In this work, we have identified a kinesin-like 
      protein in the plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum by western blotting, using 
      monoclonal antibody against kinesin (bovine brain). The molecular weight of the 
      polypeptide which immunologically cross-reacts with kinesin from bovine brain is 
      about 137kd. It suggests that the 137kd polypeptide is the heavy chain of the 
      kinesin in Physarum polycephalum.

TI  - Insertional editing in mitochondria of Physarum.
PG  - 261-6
AB  - RNA produced from a number of genes on the mitochondrial (mt) DNA of Physarum 
      polycephalum have nucleotides inserted at specific sites in their sequence. These 
      insertions are spaced at approximately 25 nucleotide intervals and create open 
      reading frames in mRNA and functional structure in tRNAs and rRNAs. Although most of 
      the insertions at a site are single cytidines; single uridines and certain 
      dinucleotides containing adenosine and guanosine as well as cytidine and uridine are 
      also occasionally inserted at certain sites. This mixed nucleotide insertional RNA 
      editing is unique among currently characterized editing systems.

TI  - Light irradiation induces fragmentation of the plasmodium, a novel 
      photomorphogenesis in the true slime mold Physarum polycephalum: action spectra and 
      evidence for involvement of the phytochrome.
PG  - 324-9
AB  - A new photomorphogenesis was found in the plasmodium of the true slime mold Physarum 
      polycephalum: the plasmodium broke temporarily into equal-sized spherical pieces, 
      each containing about eight nuclei, about 5 h after irradiation with light. Action 
      spectroscopic study showed that UVA, blue and far-red lights were effective, while 
      red light inhibited the far-red-induced fragmentation. Difference absorption spectra 
      of both the living plasmodium and the plasmodial homogenate after alternate 
      irradiation with far-red and red light gave two extremes at 750 and 680 nm, which 
      agreed with those for the induction and inhibition of the fragmentation, 
      respectively. A kinetic model similar to that of phytochrome action explained 
      quantitatively the fluence rate-response curves of the fragmentation. Our results 
      indicate that one of the photoreceptors for the plasmodial fragmentation is a 
      phytochrome.

TI  - Localization and characterization of the inhibitory Ca2+-binding site of Physarum 
      polycephalum myosin II.
PG  - 27399-405
AB  - A myosin II is thought to be the driving force of the fast cytoplasmic streaming in 
      the plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum. This regulated myosin, unique among 
      conventional myosins, is inhibited by direct Ca2+ binding. Here we report that Ca2+ 
      binds to the first EF-hand of the essential light chain (ELC) subunit of Physarum 
      myosin. Flow dialysis experiments of wild-type and mutant light chains and the 
      regulatory domain revealed a single binding site that shows moderate specificity for 
      Ca2+. The regulatory light chain, in contrast to regulatory light chains of higher 
      eukaryotes, is unable to bind divalent cations. Although the Ca2+-binding loop of 
      ELC has a canonical sequence, replacement of glutamic acid to alanine in the -z 
      coordinating position only slightly decreased the Ca2+ affinity of the site, 
      suggesting that the Ca2+ coordination is different from classical EF-hands; namely, 
      the specific "closed-to-open" conformational transition does not occur in the ELC in 
      response to Ca2+. Ca2+- and Mg2+-dependent conformational changes in the 
      microenvironment of the binding site were detected by fluorescence experiments. 
      Transient kinetic experiments showed that the displacement of Mg2+ by Ca2+ is faster 
      than the change in direction of cytoplasmic streaming; therefore, we conclude that 
      Ca2+ inhibition could operate in physiological conditions. By comparing the Physarum 
      Ca2+ site with the well studied Ca2+ switch of scallop myosin, we surmise that 
      despite the opposite effect of Ca2+ binding on the motor activity, the two 
      conventional myosins could have a common structural basis for Ca2+ regulation.

TI  - Injection of poly(beta-L-malate) into the plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum 
      shortens the cell cycle and increases the growth rate.
PG  - 3805-11
AB  - Poly(beta-L-malate) (PMLA) has been reported as an unconventional, physiologically 
      important biopolymer in plasmodia of myxomycetes, and has been proposed to function 
      in the storage and transport of nuclear proteins by mimicking the 
      phospho(deoxy)ribose backbone of nucleic acids. It is distributed in the cytoplasm 
      and especially in the nuclei of these giant, multinucleate cells. We report here for 
      the first time an increase in growth rate and a shortening of the cell cycle after 
      the injection of purified PMLA. By comparing two strains of Physarum polycephalum 
      that differed in their production levels of PMLA, it was found that growth 
      activation and cell cycle shortening correlated with the relative increases of PMLA 
      levels in the cytoplasm or the nuclei. Growth rates of a low PMLA producer strain 
      (LU897 x LU898) were increased by 40-50% while those of a high producer strain 
      (M(3)CVIII) were increased by only 0-17% in comparison with controls. In both 
      strains, shortening of the cell cycle occurred to a similar extent (7.2-9.5%), and 
      this was associated with similar increases in nuclear PMLA levels. The effects 
      showed saturation dependences with regard to the amount of injected PMLA. A steep 
      rise of intracellular PMLA shortly after injection was followed by the appearance of 
      histone H1 in the cytoplasm. The increase in growth rate, the shortening of the cell 
      cycle duration and the appearance of H1 in the cytoplasm suggest that PMLA competes 
      with nucleic acids in binding to proteins that control translation and/or 
      transcription. Thus, PMLA could play an important role in the coordination of 
      molecular pathways that are responsible for the synchronous functioning of the 
      multinucleate plasmodium.

TI  - Ionomycin and 2,5'-di(tertbutyl)-1,4,-benzohydroquinone elicit Ca2+-induced Ca2+ 
      release from intracellular pools in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 279-88
AB  - Calcium level in organelles of the slime mold Physarum polycephalum was monitored by 
      chlortetracycline, a low-affinity calcium indicator. It was found that 
      2,5'-di(tertbutyl)-1,4,-benzohydroquinone (BHQ) at a concentration of 100 microM, 
      but not the highly specific inhibitor of sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase 
      (SERCA), thapsigargin (1-10 microM), elicited calcium release from the CTC-stained 
      intracellular calcium pool. Ionomycin also caused a calcium release (23.7+/-5.1%), 
      which was less than that induced by BHQ (30.1+/-6.0%). Procaine (10 mM), a blocker 
      of ryanodine receptor, completely abolished the responses to BHQ and ionomycin. 
      Another blocker, ryanodine (100 microM), only slightly diminished the responses to 
      ionomycin and BHQ. Apparently, BHQ and ionomycin acting as a Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor 
      and an ionophore, respectively, elicit an increase in [Ca2+]i, which in turn 
      triggers a calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) via the ryanodine receptor. 
      Caffeine, an activator of ryanodine receptor, at a concentration of 25-50 mM 
      produced a Ca2+-release (5.6-16.0%), which was not similar in magnitude to CICR. The

TI  - A calmodulin-dependent protein kinase from lower eukaryote Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 838-44
AB  - A full-length cDNA coding a calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase gene was 
      cloned from Physarum plasmodia poly(A)-RNA by polymerase chain reaction with the 
      oligonucleotide primers that were designed after the amino acid sequence of highly 
      conserved regions of myosin light-chain kinase. Sequence analysis of the cDNA 
      revealed that this Physarum kinase was a 42,519-Da protein with an ATP-binding 
      domain, Ser/Thr kinase active site signature, and CaM-binding domain. Expression of 
      the cDNA in Escherichia coli demonstrated that the Physarum kinase in the presence 
      of Ca2+ and CaM phosphorylated the recombinant phosphorylatable light chain (PLc) of 
      Physarum myosin II. The peptide analysis after proteolysis of the phosphorylated PLc 
      indicated that Ser 18 was phosphorylated. The site was confirmed by the failure of 
      phosphorylation of PLc, the Ser 18 of which was replaced by Ala. The physiological 
      role of the kinase will be discussed with special reference to the 55-kDa kinase, 
      which had been previously purified from Physarum plasmodia for phosphorylated PLc.

TI  - In vivo topoisomerase II cleavage sites in the ribosomal DNA of Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 5787-95
AB  - We have analyzed the topoisomerase II cleavage sites in the extrachromosomal 
      ribosomal DNA of the lower eukaryote Physarum polycephalum using the topoisomerase 
      II-specific inhibitor, 
      6,8-difluoro-7-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-cyclopropyl-4-quinolone-3-carboxylic acid. Most 
      of the in vivo topoisomerase II cleavage sites were found either in the transcribed 
      region of ribosomal DNA or in the palindromic region surrounded by the replication 
      origins. Two classes of sites were identified: those which correlate with DNase I 
      hypersensitive sites and corresponding to an open chromatin configuration 
      (transcribed region) and internucleosomal cleavage sites (in the region of 
      replication origins). Topoisomerase II drug-induced cleavage in the ribosomal DNA 
      was considerably reduced upon Physarum differentiation to a dormant stage of life, 
      the spherules. In contrast, the amount of drug-dependent cleavage was found to 
      increase during the metaphase of mitosis, when rDNA transcription is shut off. These 
      findings suggest a role for topoisomerase II in the ribosomal DNA minichromosomes 
      segregation, in addition to its role in transcription. Finally, the similarity 
      between in vivo sites and those observed following drug treatment of isolated nuclei 
      indicates that no profound change occurs in rDNA chromatin conformation during 
      nuclei isolation. By contrast, in vitro cleavage sites with purified topoisomerase 
      II weakly correlate to in vivo, indicating a prominent role for chromatin structure 
      in determining the interaction sites of topoisomerase II with DNA in vivo.

TI  - Fine structure observations of phagotrophic activity by plasmodia of Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 67-71
AB  - Scanning electron microscopic observations of feeding plasmodia show three 
      characteristic features: 1) extension of multilobed pseudopodia protruding from the 
      leading edge of the plasmodium as it advances onto the surface of a food particle, 
      2) confluence of the lobes to form a sheath-like pseudopodium attached to the 
      surface of the food particle, and 3) protrusion of small nodules with thin lamellar 
      projections from the leading edge of the plasmodium. Sections through freeze-dried 
      preparations of the feeding plasmodium exhibit a highly convoluted under surface in 
      contact with loosened starch grains that appear to be released by extracellular 
      digestion. The cytoplasm, viewed by transmission electron microscopy, contains 
      branched, internally penetrating canals (ca. 2 microns wide) enclosing engulfed 
      starch grains. Starch grains in the deeper part of the canals are more electron 
      dense and appear to be digested. Micropseudopodia (70-80 nm dia.), projecting from 
      the surface of the canals, protrude toward and into the ingested starch grains. 
      Digestive marker enzyme (acid phosphatase) activity was detected cytochemically in 
      food particles penetrated by micropseudopodia indicating a digestive role for these 
      structures not reported previously.

AB  - The plasmodium of the acellular slime mold Physarum polycephalum is a gigantic 
      single cell visible to the unaided eye. The cell shows a rich spectrum of behavioral 
      patterns in response to environmental conditions. In a series of simple experiments 
      we demonstrate how to make computing, sensing, and actuating devices from the slime 
      mold. We show how to program living slime mold machines by configurations of 
      repelling and attracting gradients and demonstrate the workability of the living 
      machines on tasks of computational geometry, logic, and arithmetic.

TI  - Habituation in non-neural organisms: evidence from slime moulds.
LID - 10.1098/rspb.2016.0446 [doi]
LID - 20160446
AB  - Learning, defined as a change in behaviour evoked by experience, has hitherto been 
      investigated almost exclusively in multicellular neural organisms. Evidence for 
      learning in non-neural multicellular organisms is scant, and only a few unequivocal 
      reports of learning have been described in single-celled organisms. Here we 
      demonstrate habituation, an unmistakable form of learning, in the non-neural 
      organism Physarum polycephalum In our experiment, using chemotaxis as the 
      behavioural output and quinine or caffeine as the stimulus, we showed that P. 
      polycephalum learnt to ignore quinine or caffeine when the stimuli were repeated, 
      but responded again when the stimulus was withheld for a certain time. Our results 
      meet the principle criteria that have been used to demonstrate habituation: 
      responsiveness decline and spontaneous recovery. To distinguish habituation from 
      sensory adaptation or motor fatigue, we also show stimulus specificity. Our results 
      point to the diversity of organisms lacking neurons, which likely display a hitherto 
      unrecognized capacity for learning, and suggest that slime moulds may be an ideal 
      model system in which to investigate fundamental mechanisms underlying learning 
      processes. Besides, documenting learning in non-neural organisms such as slime 
      moulds is centrally important to a comprehensive, phylogenetic understanding of when 
      and where in the tree of life the earliest manifestations of learning evolved.

TI  - Localization of the newly initiated and processed ribosomal primary transcripts 
      during the mitotic cycle in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 407-20
AB  - We analyzed the fate of the rRNA released as a result of the prophasic 
      disintegration of the nucleolus, during the "closed" mitosis of the naturally 
      synchronous plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum. Using a probe complementary to the 
      mature 19S and 26S rRNA, we previously showed that the nucleolus-derived rRNAs are 
      stable in mitosis, mainly associated with numerous fibrillar nucleolar remnants 
      (Pierron and Puvion-Dutilleul, 1993, Exp. Cell Res. 208, 509-517). However, a 
      significant fraction of these mitotic rRNA precursors were also found in more 
      diffuse nuclear, granular zones. In this paper, we trace pre-rRNA molecules in the 
      early stages of their maturation by using probes derived from the 5' external 
      transcribed spacer (5'-ETS), upstream and downstream of the processing site located 
      1.7 kb from the transcription initiation site. In agreement with a previous 
      S1-mapping study (Blum et al., 1986, Nucleic Acids Res., 10, 4121-4133), we observed 
      that the rRNA transcripts complementary to the 5'-ETS portion downstream of the 
      processing site are stable in mitosis, and we demonstrate that they are specifically 
      associated with the border of the fibrillar nucleolar remnants. On the other hand, 
      the pre-rRNA chains containing the upstream portion of the 5'-ETS become 
      undetectable in mitosis, marking the cessation of rDNA transcription. Since the 
      reappearance of these nascent pre-rRNA molecules signals the resumption of the 
      transcriptional activity, we determined that a burst of rRNA synthesis is taking 
      place within the prenucleolar bodies, immediately after the separation of the 
      daughter nuclei. Taken together, our results illustrate the persistence of the 
      nucleolar components of Physarum, within nucleolar remnants that, although 
      transcriptionally inactive during mitosis, function as independent entities very 
      early in interphase.

TI  - Rapid, selective digestion of mitochondrial DNA in accordance with the matA 
      hierarchy of multiallelic mating types in the mitochondrial inheritance of Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 963-75
AB  - Although mitochondria are inherited uniparentally in nearly all eukaryotes, the 
      mechanism for this is unclear. When zygotes of the isogamous protist Physarum 
      polycephalum were stained with DAPI, the fluorescence of mtDNA in half of the 
      mitochondria decreased simultaneously to give small spots and then disappeared 
      completely approximately 1.5 hr after nuclear fusion, while the other mitochondrial 
      nucleoids and all of the mitochondrial sheaths remained unchanged. PCR analysis of 
      single zygote cells confirmed that the loss was limited to mtDNA from one parent. 
      The vacant mitochondrial sheaths were gradually eliminated by 60 hr after mating. 
      Using six mating types, the transmission patterns of mtDNA were examined in all 
      possible crosses. In 39 of 60 crosses, strict uniparental inheritance was confirmed 
      in accordance with a hierarchy of relative sexuality. In the other crosses, however, 
      mtDNA from both parents was transmitted to plasmodia. The ratio of parental mtDNA 
      was estimated to be from 1:1 to 1:10(-4). Nevertheless, the matA hierarchy was 
      followed. In these crosses, the mtDNA was incompletely digested, and mtDNA 
      replicated during subsequent plasmodial development. We conclude that the rapid, 
      selective digestion of mtDNA promotes the uniparental inheritance of mitochondria; 
      when this fails, biparental inheritance occurs.

PG  - 575-86
LID - 10.1016/j.mito.2011.03.002 [doi]
AB  - Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is generally packaged into the mitochondrial nucleoid 
      (mt-nucleoid) by a high-mobility group (HMG) protein. Glom is an mtDNA-packaging HMG 
      protein in Physarum polycephalum. Here we identified a new mtDNA-packaging protein, 
      Glom2, which had a region homologous with yeast Mgm101. Glom2 could bind to an 
      entire mtDNA and worked synergistically with Glom for condensation of mtDNA in 
      vitro. Down-regulation of Glom2 enhanced the alteration of mt-nucleoid morphology 
      and the loss of mtDNA induced by down-regulation of Glom, and impaired mRNA 
      accumulation of some mtDNA-encoded genes. These data suggest that Glom2 may organize 
      the mt-nucleoid coordinately with Glom.

LID - 23924
AB  - Slime mould Physarum polycephalum is a single cell visible by the unaided eye. Let 
      the slime mould span two electrodes with a single protoplasmic tube: if the tube is 
      heated to approximately ≈40 °C, the electrical resistance of the protoplasmic tube 
      increases from ≈3 MΩ to ≈10,000 MΩ. The organism's resistance is not proportional 
      nor correlated to the temperature of its environment. Slime mould can therefore not 
      be considered as a thermistor but rather as a thermic switch. We employ the P. 
      polycephalum thermic switch to prototype hybrid electrical analog summator, NAND 
      gates, and cascade the gates into Flip-Flop latch. Computing operations performed on 
      this bio-hybrid computing circuitry feature high repeatability, reproducibility and 
      comparably low propagation delays.

PG  - e1003960
LID - 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003960 [doi]
LID - e1003960
AB  - How social groups and organisms decide between alternative feeding sites or shelters 
      has been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically. One key result 
      is the existence of a symmetry-breaking bifurcation at a critical system size, where 
      there is a switch from evenly distributed exploitation of all options to a focussed 
      exploitation of just one. Here we present a decision-making model in which 
      symmetry-breaking is followed by a symmetry restoring bifurcation, whereby very 
      large systems return to an even distribution of exploitation amongst options. The 
      model assumes local positive feedback, coupled with a negative feedback regulating 
      the flow toward the feeding sites. We show that the model is consistent with three 
      different strains of the slime mold Physarum polycephalum, choosing between two 
      feeding sites. We argue that this combination of feedbacks could allow collective 
      foraging organisms to react flexibly in a dynamic environment.

TI  - The sequence of regulatory events in the sporulation control network of Physarum 
      polycephalum analysed by time-resolved somatic complementation of mutants.
PG  - 391-400
AB  - The developmental decision for sporulation of Physarum polycephalum plasmodia is 
      under sensory control by environmental factors like visible light or heat shock and 
      endogenous signals like glucose starvation. Several hours after perceiving an 
      inductive stimulus, plasmodia become committed to sporulation; thereby, they lose 
      their unlimited replicative potential and execute a developmental program that 
      involves differentiation into various cell types required to form a mature fruiting 
      body. Plasmodia are multinuclear single cells which spontaneously fuse upon physical 
      contact. Fusion of mutant plasmodia and cytoplasmic mixing allows complementation 
      studies to be performed at the functional level. Mutant cells altered in their 
      ability to sporulate in response to phytochrome activation by far-red light were 
      cured by fusion with wild-type or other mutant plasmodia. Phytochrome activation in 
      one plasmodium and subsequent fusion with a non-induced plasmodium revealed that 
      complementation of the two mutations depended on (i) which of two genetically 
      distinct plasmodial cells was stimulated; and (ii) on the delay time elapsed between 
      stimulation and cytoplasmic mixing. Such experiments allow us to determine the 
      kinetics and the causal sequence of the regulatory events tagged by mutation.

TI  - The one-kilobase DNA fragment upstream of the ardC actin gene of Physarum 
      polycephalum is both a replicator and a promoter.
PG  - 3506-14
AB  - The 1-kb DNA fragment upstream of the ardC actin gene of Physarum polycephalum 
      promotes the transcription of a reporter gene either in a transient-plasmid assay or 
      as an integrated copy in an ectopic position, defining this region as the 
      transcriptional promoter of the ardC gene (PardC). Since we mapped an origin of 
      replication activated at the onset of S phase within this same fragment, we examined 
      the pattern of replication of a cassette containing the PardC promoter and the 
      hygromycin phosphotransferase gene, hph, integrated into two different chromosomal 
      sites. In both cases, we show by two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis that an 
      efficient, early activated origin coincides with the ectopic PardC fragment. One of 
      the integration sites was a normally late-replicating region. The presence of the 
      ectopic origin converted this late-replicating domain into an early-replicating 
      domain in which replication forks propagate with kinetics indistinguishable from 
      those of the native PardC replicon. This is the first demonstration that initiation 
      sites for DNA replication in Physarum correspond to cis-acting replicator sequences. 
      This work also confirms the close proximity of a replication origin and a promoter, 
      with both functions being located within the 1-kb proximal region of the ardC actin 
      gene. A more precise location of the replication origin with respect to the 
      transcriptional promoter must await the development of a functional autonomously 
      replicating sequence assay in Physarum.

PG  - 7-9
AB  - A calcium binding protein with a molecular mass of 40 kDa (CBP40), the gene product 
      of plasmodial-specific LAV1-2 of Physarum polycephalum, was crystallized in the 
      presence of EDTA. The crystals diffracted X-rays up to a resolution of 3.0 A. They 
      belonged to the trigonal space group, P3221 (or P3121), with unit cell dimensions of 
      a = b = 64.4 A and c = 207.2 A. Ca2+-bound crystals were obtained by soaking in a 
      CaCl2 solution, which gave diffraction data of similar quality. The Ca2+-soaked 
      crystals belonged to the same space group as those crystallized in the presence of 
      EDTA with unit cell dimensions of a = b = 64.4 A and c = 209.4 A.

TI  - A novel 66-kDa stress protein, p66, associated with the process of cyst formation of 
      Physarum polycephalum is a Physarum homologue of a yeast actin-interacting protein, 
      AIP1.
PG  - 326-31
AB  - When exposed to various stresses including heat shock, myxoamoebae, growing haploid 
      cells of Physarum polycephalum, show marked morphological changes and consequently 
      become disk-shaped microcysts. We have found that p66 is induced exclusively in the 
      course of microcyst formation and has an actin-binding activity. In this study, we 
      purified p66 to homogeneity and isolated a p66 cDNA. The deduced protein sequence 
      contained 601 amino acids and showed 31% identity to a yeast actin-interacting 
      protein, AIP1. Northern blot analysis revealed that the amount of p66 mRNA was 
      significantly increased by heat shock in myxoamoebae but not in plasmodia. Thus, p66 
      seems to be a developmentally-expressed stress protein which regulates the 
      rearrangement of actin organization during microcyst formation in P. polycephalum.

TI  - [Involvement of cyclic adenosine monophosphate in the control of motile behavior of 
      Physarum polycephalum plasmodium].
PG  - 832-9
AB  - Possible involvement of autocrine factors into the control of motile behavior via a 
      receptor-mediated mechanism was investigated in Physarum polycephalum plasmodium, a 
      multinuclear amoeboid cell with the auto-oscillatory mode of motility. Cyclic 
      adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and extracellular cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase, 
      its involvement into the control of plasmodium motile behavior was proved by action 
      of its strong inhibitor, were regarded as putative autocrine factors. It was shown 
      that the plasmodium secreted cAMP. When it was introduced into agar support, 0,1-1 
      mM cAMP induced a delay of the plasmodium spreading and its transition to migration. 
      When locally applied, cAMP at the same concentrations induced typical for attractant 
      action the increase in oscillation frequency and the decrease of ectoplasm 
      elasticity. The ability to exhibit positive chemotaxis in cAMP gradient and the 
      dependence of its realization were shown to depend on the plasmodium state. 
      Chemotaxis test specimens obtained from the migrating plasmodium, unlike those 
      obtained from growing culture, generate alternative fronts which compete effectively 
      with fronts oriented towards the attractant increment. The results obtained support 
      our supposition stated earlier that advance of the Physarum polycephalum plasmodium 
      leading edge is determined by local extracellular cAMP gradients arising from a time 
      delay between secretion and hydrolysis of the nucleotide.

TI  - DNA replication in Physarum polycephalum: bidirectional replication of DNA within 
      replicons.
PG  - 713-21
AB  - The direction of replication of DNA within replicons of Physarum polycephalum was 
      studied by pulse-labelling with 5-bromouracil-deoxyriboside (BrdUrd) and 
      3H-adenosine deoxyriboside (dAdo), followed by ultraviolet- (UV) -photolysis and 
      analysis of molecular weights of single strand DNA fragments on alkaline sucrose 
      gradients. Newly made DNA within replicons at all stages of completion is split in 
      two equal halves upon UV irradiation when BrdUrd was given at the time of initiation 
      of DNA synthesis. This shows that replication within replicons of Physarum 
      polycephalum starts at an origin located in the center of each unit, proceeding 
      bidirectionally from this origin.

TI  - Memristive model of amoeba learning.
PG  - 021926
AB  - Recently, it was shown that the amoebalike cell Physarum polycephalum when exposed 
      to a pattern of periodic environmental changes learns and adapts its behavior in 
      anticipation of the next stimulus to come. Here we show that such behavior can be 
      mapped into the response of a simple electronic circuit consisting of a LC contour 
      and a memory-resistor (a memristor) to a train of voltage pulses that mimic 
      environment changes. We also identify a possible biological origin of the memristive 
      behavior in the cell. These biological memory features are likely to occur in other 
      unicellular as well as multicellular organisms, albeit in different forms. 
      Therefore, the above memristive circuit model, which has learning properties, is 
      useful to better understand the origins of primitive intelligence.

TI  - Rearrangements of mitochondrial DNA and the mitochondrial fusion-promoting plasmid 
      (mF) are associated with defective mitochondrial fusion in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 257-64
AB  - A specific linear mitochondrial plasmid (mF) is genetically associated with the 
      fusion of mitochondria in the true slime mould, Physarum polycephalum. In matings 
      between mF+ and mF- strains, which respectively carry and do not carry the mF 
      plasmid, mitochondrial fusion occurs in the zygote. Mitochondrial fusion induces 
      recombination between specific sites in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and in the mF 
      plasmid. To detect a region which is associated with the mitochondrial fusion in the 
      mF plasmid, we isolated, by fluorescence microscopy, strains which showed defective 
      mitochondrial fusion (delta mif-) from those which showed normal mitochondrial 
      fusion (mif+). Analysis of the mitochondrial genomes of delta mif- strains showed 
      only mtDNA which recombined with the mF plasmid in mitochondria. Comparison of this 
      recombinant mtDNA in one delta mif- strain (NG 15) with that of a mif+ strain showed 
      that a 2.2-kbp region, which included the integration site of the mF plasmid, was 
      deleted in the delta mif- strain by recombination between the main mtDNA and the mF 
      plasmid. In other strains, in addition to this deletion, a 6-kbp region which 
      included both termini was deleted by recombination at six repeats of AAT sequences 
      in the mF plasmid. Moreover, transcripts of the mF plasmid were not detected in NG15 
      by slot hybridization.

TI  - In vivo conformation of mitochondrial DNA revealed by pulsed-field gel 
      electrophoresis in the true slime mold, Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 83-91
AB  - Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to examine the in vivo and in vitro 
      conformations of Physarum polycephalum mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). We used plugs 
      containing isolated mitochondria, isolated mitochondrial nucleoids (mt-nuclei), and 
      isolated mtDNA, in addition to whole cells. The mtDNA contained in the myxamoebae, 
      plasmodia, isolated mitochondria, and isolated mt-nuclei was circular, but most of 
      the isolated mtDNA had been site-specifically fragmented and linearized during DNA 
      preparation and storage under low ionic strength conditions. Restriction mapping of 
      Physarum mtDNA by the direct digestion of the isolated mt-nuclei from two different 
      strains, DP89 x AI16 and KM88 x AI16, resulted in the circular form. A linear 
      mitochondrial plasmid, mF, is known to promote mitochondrial fusion and integration 
      of itself into the mtDNA in Physarum. Linearization of mtDNA by the integration of 
      the mF plasmid was demonstrated when we used PFGE to analyze isolated mitochondria 
      from the plasmodial strain DP89 x NG7 carrying the mF plasmid (mF+). The PFGE system 
      can be used not only to determine whether the form of mtDNA is linear or circular 
      but also to analyze the dynamic conformational changes of mtDNA.

TI  - Heat stress induces a glycosylation of membrane sterol in myxoamoebae of a true 
      slime mold, Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 486-9
AB  - To know the very early events occurring after heat shock, the changes of membrane 
      lipids were examined. Heat stress induced the production of a certain glycolipid in 
      the myxoamoebae of Physarum polycephalum in a few minutes. The purified glycolipid 
      was determined to be a poriferasterol monoglucoside by structural studies that was 
      previously reported to be expressed during the differentiation of Physarum cells 
      from haploid myxoamoebae to diploid plasmodia (Murakami-Murofushi, K., Nakamura, K., 
      Ohta, J., Suzuki, M., Suzuki, A., Murofushi, H., and Yokota, T. (1987) J. Biol. 
      Chem. 262, 16719-16723). The activity of UDP-glucose:poriferasterol 
      glucosyltransferase (Murakami-Murofushi, K., and Ohta, J. (1989) Biochim. Biophys. 
      Acta 992, 412-415) was also expressed rapidly after heat shock. Thus, the activation 
      of sterol glucosyltransferase and the production of sterol-glucoside were considered 
      to be important events that were involved in the signal transduction system to 
      induce some succeeding heat-shock responses, such as the synthesis of heat-shock 
      proteins.

TI  - Characteristics of pattern formation and evolution in approximations of Physarum 
      transport networks.
PG  - 127-53
LID - 10.1162/artl.2010.16.2.16202 [doi]
AB  - Most studies of pattern formation place particular emphasis on its role in the 
      development of complex multicellular body plans. In simpler organisms, however, 
      pattern formation is intrinsic to growth and behavior. Inspired by one such 
      organism, the true slime mold Physarum polycephalum, we present examples of complex 
      emergent pattern formation and evolution formed by a population of simple 
      particle-like agents. Using simple local behaviors based on chemotaxis, the mobile 
      agent population spontaneously forms complex and dynamic transport networks. By 
      adjusting simple model parameters, maps of characteristic patterning are obtained. 
      Certain areas of the parameter mapping yield particularly complex long term 
      behaviors, including the circular contraction of network lacunae and bifurcation of 
      network paths to maintain network connectivity. We demonstrate the formation of 
      irregular spots and labyrinthine and reticulated patterns by chemoattraction. Other 
      Turing-like patterning schemes were obtained by using chemorepulsion behaviors, 
      including the self-organization of regular periodic arrays of spots, and striped 
      patterns. We show that complex pattern types can be produced without resorting to 
      the hierarchical coupling of reaction-diffusion mechanisms. We also present network 
      behaviors arising from simple pre-patterning cues, giving simple examples of how the 
      emergent pattern formation processes evolve into networks with functional and 
      quasi-physical properties including tensionlike effects, network minimization 
      behavior, and repair to network damage. The results are interpreted in relation to 
      classical theories of biological pattern formation in natural systems, and we 
      suggest mechanisms by which emergent pattern formation processes may be used as a 
      method for spatially represented unconventional computation.

TI  - Specific inhibition of Physarum polycephalum DNA-polymerase-alpha-primase by 
      poly(L-malate) and related polyanions.
PG  - 1-6
AB  - Poly(L-malate) is an unusual polyanion found in nuclei of plasmodia of Physarum 
      polycephalum. We have investigated, by enzymatic and fluorimetric methods, whether 
      poly(L-malate) and structurally related polyanions can interact with 
      DNA-polymerase-alpha-primase complex and with histones of P. polycephalum. 
      Poly(L-malate) is found to inhibit the activities of the 
      DNA-polymerase-alpha-primase complex and to bind to histones. The mode of inhibition 
      is competitive with regard to DNA in elongation and noncompetitive in the priming of 
      DNA synthesis. Spermidine, spermine, and histones from P. polycephalum and from calf 
      thymus bind to poly(L-malate) and antagonize the inhibition. The polyanions 
      poly(vinyl sulfate), poly(acrylate), poly(L-malate), poly(D,L-malate), 
      poly(L-aspartate), poly(L-glutamate) have been examined for their potency to inhibit 
      the DNA polymerase. The degree of inhibition is found to depend on the distance 
      between neighboring charges, given by the number of atoms (N) interspaced between 
      them. Poly(L-malate) (N = 5) and poly(D,L-malate) (N = 5) are the most efficient 
      inhibitors, followed by poly(L-aspartate) (N = 6), poly(acrylate) (N = 3), 
      poly(L-glutamate) (N = 8), poly(vinyl sulfate) (N = 3). It is proposed that 
      poly(L-malate) interacts with DNA-polymerase-alpha-primase of P. polycephalum. 
      According to its physical and biochemical properties, poly(L-malate) may 
      alternatively function as a molecular chaperone in nucleosome assembly in the S 
      phase and as both an inhibitor and a stock-piling agent of 
      DNA-polymerase-alpha-primase in the G2 phase and M phase of the plasmodial cell 
      cycle.

TI  - Effects of tubulozole on the amoeboflagellate transformation in Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 1055-60
AB  - The Amoeboflagellate Transformation (AFT) of Physarum polycephalum involves rapid 
      changes in the cytoskeleton, cell shape and cell motility. Use of pharmacologic 
      agents to probe the role of cytoskeletal elements in the AFT are impeded because the 
      transforming cells are very sensitive to such commonly-used drug solvents as DMSO. 
      The anti-microtubule agent tubulozole is found to disrupt, rapidly and transiently, 
      the AFT, inhibiting flagella formation, cell elongation and the arrangement of 
      microtubules and microfilaments. Cells recover quickly, possibly due to 
      precipitation of the drug; the reappearance of normal arrays of microfilaments and 
      cytoplasmic microtubules lags behind flagella formation.

AB  - Learning and memory are indisputably key features of animal success. Using 
      information about past experiences is critical for optimal decision-making in a 
      fluctuating environment. Those abilities are usually believed to be limited to 
      organisms with a nervous system, precluding their existence in non-neural organisms. 
      However, recent studies showed that the slime mould Physarum polycephalum, despite 
      being unicellular, displays habituation, a simple form of learning. In this paper, 
      we studied the possible substrate of both short- and long-term habituation in slime 
      moulds. We habituated slime moulds to sodium, a known repellent, using a 6 day 
      training and turned them into a dormant state named sclerotia. Those slime moulds 
      were then revived and tested for habituation. We showed that information acquired 
      during the training was preserved through the dormant stage as slime moulds still 
      showed habituation after a one-month dormancy period. Chemical analyses indicated a 
      continuous uptake of sodium during the process of habituation and showed that sodium 
      was retained throughout the dormant stage. Lastly, we showed that memory inception 
      via constrained absorption of sodium for 2 h elicited habituation. Our results 
      suggest that slime moulds absorbed the repellent and used it as a 'circulating 
      memory'. This article is part of the theme issue 'Liquid brains, solid brains: How 
      distributed cognitive architectures process information'.

TI  - GTP cyclohydrolase I mRNA: novel splice variants in the slime mould Physarum 
      polycephalum and in human monocytes (THP-1) indicate conservation of mRNA 
      processing.
PG  - 499-507
AB  - GTP cyclohydrolase I (EC 3.5.4.16) is the first enzyme in the biosynthesis of 
      tetrahydrobiopterin [(6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-L-biopterin, H(4)-biopterin] in mammals 
      and of folic acid in bacteria. Here we have characterized the GTP cyclohydrolase I 
      gene structure and two mRNA species from Physarum polycephalum, an acellular slime 
      mould that synthesizes H(4)-biopterin and metabolites of the folic acid biosynthetic 
      pathway. Its GTP cyclohydrolase I gene consists of seven exons, and the two GTP 
      cyclohydrolase I cDNA species isolated from Physarum encode for proteins with 228 
      (25.7 kDa) and 195 (22.1 kDa) amino acids. Furthermore, we identified two previously 
      undescribed mRNA species in interferon-gamma-treated human myelomonocytoma cells 
      (THP-1) in addition to the cDNA coding for the fully functional 250-residue (27.9 
      kDa) protein, which is identical with that in human phaeochromocytoma cells. One of 
      the new splice variants codes for a 233-residue (25.7 kDa) protein, whereas the 
      other codes for the full-length protein but is alternatively spliced within the 
      3'-untranslated region. In heterologous expression, the shorter proteins of Physarum 
      as well as of THP-1 cells identified here are degraded by proteolysis. Accordingly, 
      only the 27.9 kDa protein was detectable in Western blots from THP-1 cell extracts. 
      Quantification of GTP cyclohydrolase I mRNA species in different human cell types 
      with and without cytokine treatment showed that in addition to the correct mRNA the 
      two splice variants isolated here, as well as the two splice variants known from 
      human liver, are strongly induced by cytokines in cell types with inducible GTP 
      cyclohydrolase I (THP-1, dermal fibroblasts), but not in cell types with 
      constitutive GTP cyclohydrolase I expression (SK-N-SH, Hep-G2). As in human liver, 
      splicing of the new mRNA variant found in THP-1 cells occurs at the boundary of 
      exons 5 and 6. Strikingly, the 195-residue protein from Physarum is alternatively 
      spliced at a homologous position, i.e. at the boundary of exons 6 and 7. Thus 
      alternative splicing of GTP cyclohydrolase I at this position occurs in two species 
      highly distant from each other in terms of evolution. It remains to be seen whether

PG  - 950-60
AB  - Somatic complementation by fusion of two mutant cells and mixing of their cytoplasms 
      occurs when the genetic defect of one fusion partner is cured by the functional gene 
      product provided by the other. We have found that complementation of mutational 
      defects in the network mediating stimulus-induced commitment and sporulation of 
      Physarum polycephalum may reflect time-dependent changes in the signaling state of 
      its molecular building blocks. Network perturbation by fusion of mutant plasmodial 
      cells in different states of activation, and the time-resolved analysis of somatic 
      complementation effects can be used to systematically probe network structure and 
      dynamics. Time-resolved somatic complementation quantitatively detects regulatory 
      interactions between the functional modules of a network, independent of their 
      biochemical composition or subcellular localization, and without being limited to 
      direct physical interactions.

TI  - Effects of Ca2+-ATPase inhibitors, ionomycin, and pharmacological modulators of 
      ryanodine receptor on calcium release from intracellular pools and on oscillatory 
      contractile behavior in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 662-71
AB  - Changes in calcium levels in organelles of the plasmodium of the myxomycete Physarum 
      polycephalum were analyzed using the fluorescent calcium indicator chlortetracycline 
      (CTC). Both the Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor 2,5;-di(tert-butyl)-1,4-benzohydroquinone 
      (BHQ) (100 microM) and the calcium ionophore ionomycin (1 microM) induce a 
      significant decrease in fluorescence level (by 30%) in CTC-stained microplasmodia; 
      this is caused by release of calcium from intracellular storage compartments. An 
      activator of ryanodine receptors, caffeine (10-50 mM), is less effective on Ca2+ 
      release than BHQ or ionomycin, and their inhibitor, ryanodine (100 microM), almost 
      completely blocks the response to caffeine, but only slightly decreases the effects 
      of BHQ or ionomycin. Procaine, another inhibitor of ryanodine receptors, at 10 mM 
      concentration completely abolishes both the BHQ and the ionomycin responses, but 50 
      mM is necessary to block the effect of 25 mM caffeine. These results suggest that 
      both the BHQ- and the ionomycin-dependent Ca2+ releases occur through the ryanodine 
      receptor and are to be considered as calcium-induced Ca2+ release (CICR). Both the 
      ionomycin and the BHQ responses persist in the presence of Cd2+, which blocks Ca2+ 
      channels of the plasmalemma. In most cases, Cd2+ itself induces release of Ca2+ from 
      the CTC-stained calcium pool; the more effective Cd2+ is, the less the following 
      ionomycin or BHQ responses occur. This indicates that Ca2+ entry through plasmalemma 
      plays no significant role in the ionomycin- or BHQ-evoked initiation of CICR, and 
      that the Cd2+- and BHQ/ionomycin-depleted Ca2+ stores overlap.

TI  - Rhythmicity in the protoplasmic streaming of a slime mold, Physarum polycephalum. I. 
      A statistical analysis of the electric potential rhythm.
PG  - 1205-22
AB  - The electric potential difference (1 to 15 mv.) between two loci of the slime mold 
      connected with a strand of protoplasm changes rhythmically with the same period (60 
      to 180 seconds) as that of the back and forth protoplasmic streaming along the 
      strand. Generally some phase difference is observed between them. Periods of the 
      electric potential rhythm show a Gaussian distribution. Amplitudes give a somewhat 
      different distribution curve. Wave forms are not always simple harmonic ones, but 
      are distorted more or less. However, auto-correlation analysis proves that there is 
      a dominant rhythm of a nearly constant period which coincides with the mean period 
      of the Gaussian distribution curve. Calculations made on an assumption that the 
      electric potential rhythm is the result of many elementary rhythms (i.e., same 
      periodicity, arbitrary phase angles) distributed throughout the plasmodium, give a 
      satisfactory coincidence with the observed distribution for the amplitude. The 
      predominance of a rhythm of a nearly constant periodicity suggests the existence of 
      well organized interactions among components of a contractile protein network, the 
      rhythmic deformation of which is supposed to be responsible for the protoplasmic 
      streaming and for the electric potential rhythm.

TI  - Rebuilding Iberian motorways with slime mould.
PG  - 89-100
LID - 10.1016/j.biosystems.2011.03.007 [doi]
AB  - Plasmodium of a cellular slime mould Physarum polycephalum is a unique living 
      substrate proved to be efficient in solving many computational problems with natural 
      spatial parallelism. The plasmodium solves a problem represented by a configuration 
      of source of nutrients by building an efficient foraging and intra-cellular 
      transportation network. The transportation networks developed by the plasmodium are 
      similar to transport networks built by social insects and simulated trails in 
      multi-agent societies. In the paper we are attempting to answer the question "How 
      close plasmodium of P. polycephalum approximates man-made motorway networks in Spain 
      and Portugal, and what are the differences between existing motorway structure and 
      plasmodium network of protoplasmic tubes?". We cut agar plates in a shape of Iberian 
      peninsula, place oat flakes at the sites of major urban areas and analyse the 
      foraging network developed. We compare the plasmodium network with principle 
      motorways and also analyse man-made and plasmodium networks in a framework of planar 
      proximity graphs.

TI  - Enhanced self-splicing of Physarum polycephalum intron 3 by a second group I intron.
PG  - 183-93
AB  - The third group I intron of Physarum polycephalum is found at the same site in the 
      large subunit rRNA as the well-characterized intron from Tetrahymena thermophila. 
      Formation of alternative structures in the rRNA can inhibit self-splicing of the 
      Tetrahymena intron. We report that splicing of Physarum intron 3 is also influenced 
      by adjacent sequences. In this case, however, splicing is stimulated by the presence 
      of a second group I intron 24 nucleotides downstream. In vitro, intron 3 
      self-splices 10-25-fold faster in transcripts containing both introns. In vivo, 
      intron 3 is excised from pre-rRNA before intron 2 in the majority of transcripts, as 
      judged by PCR amplification of processing intermediates. This is an unusual example 
      in which self-splicing is enhanced by the juxtaposition of two group I introns. This 
      cooperative effect may be mediated by a conformational change in the rRNA.

TI  - Robot control with biological cells.
PG  - 215-23
AB  - At present there exists a large gap in size, performance, adaptability and 
      robustness between natural and artificial information processors for performing 
      coherent perception-action tasks under real-time constraints. Even the simplest 
      organisms have an enviable capability of coping with an unknown dynamic environment. 
      Robots, in contrast, are still clumsy if confronted with such complexity. This paper 
      presents a bio-hybrid architecture developed for exploring an alternate approach to 
      the control of autonomous robots. Circuits prepared from amoeboid plasmodia of the 
      slime mold Physarum polycephalum are interfaced with an omnidirectional hexapod 
      robot. Sensory signals from the macro-physical environment of the robot are 
      transduced to cellular scale and processed using the unique micro-physical features 
      of intracellular information processing. Conversely, the response form the cellular 
      computation is amplified to yield a macroscopic output action in the environment 
      mediated through the robot's actuators.

TI  - Cloning and genomic sequence of the Physarum polycephalum Ppras1 gene, a homologue 
      of the ras protooncogene.
PG  - 143-4
AB  - We have cloned the genomic copy of the Ppras1 gene, a homologue of the ras 
      proto-oncogene, from the true slime mold Physarum polycephalum. Ppras1 contains five 
      small introns, four of which have a high content of pyrimidines. The 
      (dC)-homopolymers present in introns 4 and 5 may be responsible for the observed 
      recA-independent deletion in Ppras1 upon amplification of the Ppras1-bearing plasmid 
      by choramphenicol. Although Ppras1 exhibits amino acid and nucleotide homologies 
      with the DdrasG gene, a homologue of ras from another slime mold, Distyostelium 
      discoideum, locations and sequences of their introns are quite different. This 
      discordance suggests that introns of the ras genes in these species were acquired 
      independently.

TI  - A cDNA cloned from Physarum polycephalum encodes new type of family 3 
      beta-glucosidase that is a fusion protein containing a calx-beta motif.
PG  - 2164-72
AB  - The microplasmodia of Physarum polycephalum express three types of 
      beta-glucosidases: secretory enzyme, a soluble cytoplasmic enzyme and a 
      membrane-bound enzyme. We are interested in the physiological role of three enzymes. 
      We report the sequence of cDNA for membrane beta-glucosidase 1, which consists of 
      3825 nucleotides that includes an open reading frame encoding 1248 amino acids. The 
      molecular weight of membrane beta-glucosidase 1 was calculated to be 131,843 based 
      on the predicted amino acid composition. Glycosyl hydrolase family 3 N-terminal and 
      C-terminal domains were found within the N-terminal half of the membrane 
      beta-glucosidase 1 sequence and were highly homologous with the primary structures 
      of fungal beta-glucosidases. Notably, the C-terminal half of membrane 
      beta-glucosidase 1 contains two calx-beta motifs, which are known to be Ca(2+) 
      binding domains in the Drosophila Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger; an RGD sequence, which is 
      known to be a cell attachment sequence; and a transmembrane region. In this way, 
      Physarum membrane beta-glucosidase 1 differs from all previously identified family 3 
      beta-glucosidases. In addition to cDNA for membrane beta-glucosidase 1, two other 
      distinctly different mRNAs were also isolated. Two sequences were largely identical 
      to cDNA for membrane beta-glucosidase 1, but included a long insert sequence having 
      a stop codon, leading to truncation of their products, which could account for other 
      beta-glucosidase forms occurred in Physarum poycephalum. Thus, the membrane 
      beta-glucosidase is a new type family 3 enzyme fused with the Calx-beta domain. We 
      propose that Calx-beta domain may modulate the beta-glucosidase activity in response 
      to changes in the Ca(2+) concentration.

LID - 10.1016/j.jmb.2010.11.024 [doi]
AB  - Physarum polycephalum hemagglutinin I (HA1) is a 104-residue protein that is 
      secreted to extracellular space. The crystal structure of HA1 has a β-sandwich fold 
      found among lectin structures, such as legume lectins and galectins. Interestingly, 
      the β-sandwich of HA1 lacks a jelly roll motif and is essentially composed of two 
      simple up-and-down β-sheets. This up-and-down β-sheet motif is well conserved in 
      other legume lectin-like proteins derived from animals, plants, bacteria, and 
      viruses. It is more noteworthy that the up-and-down β-sheet motif includes many 
      residues that make contact with the target carbohydrates. Our NMR data demonstrate 
      that HA1 lacking a jelly roll motif also binds to its target glycopeptide. Taken 
      together, these data show that the up-and-down β-sheet motif provides a fundamental 
      scaffold for the binding of legume lectin-like proteins to the target carbohydrates, 
      and the structure of HA1 suggests a minimal carbohydrate recognition domain.

TI  - Gravitational response of the slime mold Physarum.
PG  - 21-34
AB  - The acellular slime mold Physarum polycephalum is used as a model system to 
      investigate the graviresponse of single cells which possess no receptors specialized 
      for the perception of gravity. To obtain insights into the gravity-signal 
      transduction mechanism the light response of the cell is used: Macroplasmodia of the 
      slime mold show clear geo- and phototaxes. Gravity increases and white light 
      decreases transiently the contraction frequency of plasmodial strands whereby both 
      responses follow the same time pattern. Since mitochondria play a major role in 
      changing the contraction rhythm in response to light and gravity stimuli, the 
      simultaneous and subsequent inductions of the opposing light and gravity responses 
      and their mutual influences on one another were investigated. The experiments were 
      performed in weightlessness (0 g)--simulated on the fast-rotating clinostat as well 
      as in actual weightlessness during the IML-1 Space Shuttle mission. The results 
      indicate that mitochondria (chondriome) are part of the acceleration-stimulus 
      reaction chain in Physarum. Two models for a direct gravireceptor mechanism are 
      discussed.

TI  - Biological functions of a novel lipid mediator, cyclic phosphatidic acid.
PG  - 1-7
AB  - A novel bioactive lipid, cyclic phosphatidic acid (cPA), was isolated originally 
      from myxoamoebae of a true slime mold, Physarum polycephalum, and has now been 
      detected in a wide range of organisms from slime molds to humans. It has a cyclic 
      phosphate at the sn-2 and sn-3 positions of the glycerol carbons, and this structure 
      is absolutely necessary for its activities. This substance shows specific biological 
      functions, including antimitogenic regulation of the cell cycle, regulation of actin 
      stress fiber formation and rearrangement, inhibition of cancer cell invasion and 
      metastasis, regulation of differentiation and viability of neuronal cells, and 
      mobilization of intracellular calcium. Although the structure of cPA is similar to 
      that of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), its biological activities are apparently 
      distinct from those of LPA. In the present review, we focus mainly on the enzymatic 
      formation of cPA, the antimitogenic regulation of the cell cycle, the inhibition of 
      cancer cell invasion and metastasis, and the neurotrophic effect of cPA.

TI  - Traffic optimization in railroad networks using an algorithm mimicking an 
      amoeba-like organism, Physarum plasmodium.
PG  - 225-32
LID - 10.1016/j.biosystems.2011.05.001 [doi]
AB  - Traffic optimization of railroad networks was considered using an algorithm that was 
      biologically inspired by an amoeba-like organism, plasmodium of the true slime mold, 
      Physarum polycephalum. The organism developed a transportation network consisting of 
      a tubular structure to transport protoplasm. It was reported that plasmodium can 
      find the shortest path interconnecting multiple food sites during an adaptation 
      process (Nakagaki et al., 2001. Biophys. Chem. 92, 47-52). By mimicking the 
      adaptation process a path finding algorithm was developed by Tero et al. (2007). In 
      this paper, the algorithm is newly modified for applications of traffic distribution 
      optimization in transportation networks of infrastructure such as railroads under 
      the constraint that the network topology is given. Application of the algorithm to a 
      railroad in metropolitan Tokyo, Japan is demonstrated. The results are evaluated 
      using three performance functions related to cost, traveling efficiency, and network 
      weakness. The traffic distribution suggests that the modified Physarum algorithm 
      balances the performances under a certain parameter range, indicating a biological 
      process.

TI  - [A cyclin A-like protein is localized in the cells of Physarum polycephalum and 
      functions in the cell cycle].
PG  - 479-84
AB  - The subcellular distribution of a Cyclin A-like protein in the cells of Physarum 
      polycephalum and the function of the protein in the cell cycle were studied by 
      immunoelectron microscope and anti-Cyclin A antibody blocking. After labeled with an 
      anti-Cyclin A monoclonal antibody, the density of gold particles in the labeled 
      specimens was much higher than that in the control, indicating that a Cyclin A-like 
      protein existed in Physarum polycephalum. In the labeled specimen, the gold 
      particles density of the nucleus was higher than that of cytoplasm, which was 
      similar to that of the control, demonstrating that the Cyclin A-like protein was a 
      nuclear protein. The gold particles density of the nuclei varied during the cell 
      cycle. The highest appeared in S phase and the lowest came in metaphase and 
      ana-telophase, which was close to that in the control. From S phase to metaphase, 
      the gold particle densities dropped down gradually. The changes in the gold particle 
      density showed the changes in the content of the Cyclin A-like protein. After 
      treated with the anti-Cyclin A antibody in S phase and G2 phase respectively, the 
      nuclei of Physarum polycephalum were arrested in the phases and the morphology of 
      these nuclei became irregular. When treated with the anti-Cyclin A antibody in 
      prophase, the nuclei appeared abnormal. These results suggested that the Cyclin 
      A-like protein is important in cell cycle regulation of Physarum polycephalum, 
      essentially in S/G2 and G2/M changes.

      accurately and fully edited, yet the signals guiding these precise nucleotide 
      insertions are presently unknown. To localize the regions of the template that are 
      required for editing, we constructed a series of chimeric templates that substitute 
      varying amounts of DNA either upstream of or downstream from C insertion sites. 
      Remarkably, all sequences necessary for C addition are contained within 
      approximately 9 base pairs on either side of the insertion site. In addition, our 
      data strongly suggest that sequences within this critical region affect different 
      steps in the editing reaction. Template alterations upstream of an editing site 
      influence nucleotide selection and/or insertion, while downstream changes affect 
      editing site recognition and templated extension from the added, unpaired 
      nucleotide. The data presented here provide the first evidence that individual 
      regions of the DNA template play discrete mechanistic roles and represent a crucial 
      initial step toward defining the source of the editing specificity in Physarum 
      mitochondria. In addition, these findings have mechanistic implications regarding 
      the potential involvement of the mitochondrial RNA polymerase in the editing 
      reaction.

TI  - Two forms of RNA editing are required for tRNA maturation in Physarum mitochondria.
PG  - 482-8
LID - 10.1261/rna.1958810 [doi]
AB  - The mitochondrial genome of Physarum polycephalum encodes five tRNAs, four of which 
      are edited by nucleotide insertion. Two of these tRNAs, tRNA(met1) and tRNA(met2), 
      contain predicted mismatches at the beginning (proximal end) of the acceptor stem. 
      In addition, the putative 5' end of tRNA(met2) overlaps the 3' end of a small, 
      abundant, noncoding RNA, which we term ppoRNA. These anomalies led us to hypothesize 
      that these two Physarum mitochondrial tRNAs undergo additional editing events. Here, 
      we show that tRNA(met1) and tRNA(met2) each has a nonencoded G at its 5' end. In 
      contrast to the other nucleotides that are added to Physarum mitochondrial RNAs, 
      these extra G residues are likely added post-transcriptionally based on (1) the 
      absence of added G in precursor transcripts containing inserted C and AA residues, 
      (2) the presence of potential intermediates characteristic of 5' replacement 
      editing, and (3) preferential incorporation of GTP into tRNA molecules under 
      conditions that do not support transcription. This is the first report of both 
      post-transcriptional nucleotide insertions and the addition of single Gs in P. 
      polycephalum mitochondrial transcripts. We postulate that tRNA(met1) and tRNA(met2) 
      are acted upon by an activity similar to that present in the mitochondria of certain 
      other amoebozoons and chytrid fungi, suggesting that enzymes that repair the 5' end 
      of tRNAs may be widespread.

TI  - Molecular and cellular mechanisms of mitochondrial nuclear division and 
      mitochondriokinesis.
PG  - 220-32
AB  - Our present understanding of mitochondrial division can be summarized as follows: 
      Mitochondria contain a specific genome, synthesize their own DNA, and multiply 
      semi-autonomously. Strands of mitochondrial DNA (mt-DNA) in the in vivo organelles 
      of all eukaryotes are organized to form mitochondrial nuclei (nucleoids) (mt-nuclei) 
      with specific proteins including a histone-like protein and transcription factors at 
      the central region of the mitochondrion. We can easily observe the mt-nucleus in 
      vivo mitochondria in various organisms such as fungi, algae, plants, and animals by 
      using high-resolution epifluorescence microscopy. Therefore, the process of 
      mitochondrial division can be clearly separated into two main events: division of 
      the mt-nuclei and mitochondriokinesis analogous to cytokinesis. Mitochondria undergo 
      binary division which is accompanied by the division of the mt-nucleus. A remarkable 
      characteristic of mitochondrial multiplication during the mitochondrial life cycle 
      is that mitochondria can multiply the mt-chromosome by endoduplication until 50-100 
      copies are present. Mitochondria can then divide without mitochondrial DNA synthesis 
      to eventually contain 1-5 copies of the mt-chromosome. This characteristic 
      phenomenon can be observed during cell differentiation, such as during the formation 
      of plasmodia and sclerotia of Physarum polycephalum and during embryogenesis and the 
      formation of meristematic tissues in plants. The mitochondrial chromosome has a 
      mitochondrial "kinetochore (centromere)" which is A-T rich and contains specific 
      sequences such as topoisomerase binding sites, tandem repeats, and inverted repeats. 
      A bridge of proteins may exist between the kinetochore DNA and membrane systems. 
      Mitochondrial chromosomes can divide according to the growth of a membrane system 
      between the kinetochores. Mitochondriokinesis progresses steadily along with 
      mitochondrial nuclear division. As the membrane at the equatorial region of a 
      mitochondrion contracts, the neck of the cleavage furrow narrows, and eventually the 
      daughter mitochondria are separated. An actin-like protein may power 
      mitochondriokinesis by separating the daughter mitochondria. In general, 
      mitochondriokinesis occurs by contraction rather than by partition of the inner 
      membrane.

TI  - Developmentally regulated usage of Physarum DNA replication origins.
PG  - 474-8
AB  - To determine the extent to which eukaryotic replication origins are developmentally 
      regulated in transcriptionally competent cells, we compared origin use in untreated 
      growing amoebae and plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum. At loci that contain genes 
      transcribed in both developmental stages, such as the ribosomal RNA genes and two 
      unlinked actin genes, we show that there is a similar replicational organization, 
      with the same origins used with comparable efficiencies, as shown by two-dimensional 
      agarose-gel electrophoresis. By contrast, we found cell-type-specific replication 
      patterns for the homologous, unlinked profilin A (proA) and profilin P (proP) genes. 
      proA is replicated from a promoter-proximal origin in amoebae, in which it is highly 
      expressed, and is replicated passively in the plasmodium, in which it is not 
      expressed. Conversely, proP is replicated passively and is not expressed in amoebae, 
      but coincides with an efficient origin when highly expressed in the plasmodium. Our 
      results show a reprogramming of S phase that is linked to the reprogramming of 
      transcription during Physarum cell differentiation. This is achieved by the use of 
      two classes of promoter-associated replication origins: those that are 
      constitutively active and those that are developmentally regulated. This suggests 
      that replication origins, like genes, are under epigenetic control associated with 
      cellular differentiation.

AB  - A living system reveals local computing by referring to a whole system beyond the 
      exploration-exploitation dilemma. The slime mold, Physarum polycephalum, uses 
      protoplasmic flow to change its own outer shape, which yields the boundary condition 
      and forms an adaptive and robust network. This observation suggests that the whole 
      Physarum can be represented as a local protoplasmic flow system. Here, we show that 
      a system composed of particles, which move and are modified based upon the particle 
      transformation that contains the relationship between the parts and the whole, can 
      emulate the network formed by Physarum. This system balances the 
      exploration-exploitation trade-off and shows a scale-free sub-domain. By decreasing 
      the number of particles, our model, VP-S, can emulate the Physarum adaptive network 
      as it is attracted to a food stimulus. By increasing the number of particles, our 
      model, VP-D, can emulate the pattern of a growing Physarum. The patterns produced by 
      our model were compared with those of the Physarum pattern quantitatively, which 
      showed that both patterns balance exploration with exploitation. This model should 
      have a wide applicability to study biological collective phenomena in general.

AB  - We analyzed the developmental switch to sporulation of a multinucleate Physarum 
      polycephalum plasmodial cell, a complex response to phytochrome photoreceptor 
      activation. Automatic construction of Petri nets representing finite state machines 
      assembled from trajectories of differential gene expression in single cells revealed 
      alternative, genotype-dependent interconnected developmental routes and identified 
      reversible steps, metastable states, commitment points, and subsequent irreversible 
      steps together with molecular signatures associated with cell fate decision and 
      differentiation. Formation of cyclic transits identified by transition invariants in 
      mutants that are locked in a proliferative state is remarkable considering the view 
      that oncogenic alterations may cause the formation of cancer attractors. We conclude 
      that the Petri net approach is useful to probe the Waddington landscape of cellular 
      reprogramming, to disentangle developmental routes for the reconstruction of the 
      gene regulatory network, and to understand how genetic alterations or physiological 
      conditions reshape the landscape eventually creating new basins of attraction. 
      Unraveling the complexity of pathogenesis, disease progression, drug response or the 
      analysis of attractor landscapes in other complex systems of uncertain structure 
      might be additional fields of application.

TI  - Decision-making without a brain: how an amoeboid organism solves the two-armed 
      bandit.

LID - 20160030
AB  - Several recent studies hint at shared patterns in decision-making between 
      taxonomically distant organisms, yet few studies demonstrate and dissect mechanisms 
      of decision-making in simpler organisms. We examine decision-making in the 
      unicellular slime mould Physarum polycephalum using a classical decision problem 
      adapted from human and animal decision-making studies: the two-armed bandit problem. 
      This problem has previously only been used to study organisms with brains, yet here 
      we demonstrate that a brainless unicellular organism compares the relative qualities 
      of multiple options, integrates over repeated samplings to perform well in random 
      environments, and combines information on reward frequency and magnitude in order to 
      make correct and adaptive decisions. We extend our inquiry by using Bayesian model 
      selection to determine the most likely algorithm used by the cell when making 
      decisions. We deduce that this algorithm centres around a tendency to exploit 
      environments in proportion to their reward experienced through past sampling. The 
      algorithm is intermediate in computational complexity between simple, reactionary 
      heuristics and calculation-intensive optimal performance algorithms, yet it has very 
      good relative performance. Our study provides insight into ancestral mechanisms of 
      decision-making and suggests that fundamental principles of decision-making, 
      information processing and even cognition are shared among diverse biological 
      systems.

AB  - When plasmodia of the true slime mold Physarum were exposed to unfavorable 
      conditions presented as three consecutive pulses at constant intervals, they reduced 
      their locomotive speed in response to each episode. When the plasmodia were 
      subsequently subjected to favorable conditions, they spontaneously reduced their 
      locomotive speed at the time when the next unfavorable episode would have occurred. 
      This implied the anticipation of impending environmental change. We explored the 
      mechanisms underlying these types of behavior from a dynamical systems perspective.

TI  - DNA methylation during differentiation of a lower eukaryote, Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 101-4
AB  - Starvation-induced differentiation of the slime mould Physarum polycephalum is 
      accompanied by continuous methylation of DNA. No stable changes in the overall level 
      of DNA methylation are evident, but a gene known to be transcribed specifically 
      during differentiation is subject to increased methylation. Inhibitors of DNA 
      methylation preclude differentiation of P. polycephalum, although they are only 
      marginally inhibitory to normal growth. Taken together these results indicate that 
      methylation of DNA is involved in differentiation of this lower eukaryote.

TI  - Purification and some properties of hemagglutinin from the Myxomycete, Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 544-8
AB  - A new hemagglutinin was isolated from the plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum by 
      salting out with ammonium sulphate followed by chromatography on DE-32, 
      DEAE-Toyopearl and hydroxyapatite. This hemagglutinin, named physarumin, was 
      purified 1000-fold over crude extracts. The molecular weight of physarumin was 
      determined to be 22,000 by size exclusion chromatography on Bio-Gel P-60 and 8,700 
      by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Physarumin agglutinated rabbit, guinea 
      pig, horse and human erythrocytes. Physarumin-induced hemagglutination was inhibited 
      by fetuin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, but not by commercially available mono- and 
      disaccharides. Hemagglutinating activity was blocked by EDTA, and was restored by 
      adding Ca2+ but not by Mg2+.

TI  - Evolving Transport Networks With Cellular Automata Models Inspired by Slime Mould.
PG  - 1887-99
LID - 10.1109/TCYB.2014.2361731 [doi]
AB  - Man-made transport networks and their design are closely related to the shortest 
      path problem and considered amongst the most debated problems of computational 
      intelligence. Apart from using conventional or bio-inspired computer algorithms, 
      many researchers tried to solve this kind of problem using biological computing 
      substrates, gas-discharge solvers, prototypes of a mobile droplet, and hot ice 
      computers. In this aspect, another example of biological computer is the plasmodium 
      of acellular slime mould Physarum polycephalum (P. polycephalum), which is a large 
      single cell visible by an unaided eye and has been proven as a reliable living 
      substrate for implementing biological computing devices for computational geometry, 
      graph-theoretical problems, and optimization and imitation of transport networks. 
      Although P. polycephalum is easy to experiment with, computing devices built with 
      the living slime mould are extremely slow; it takes slime mould days to execute a 
      computation. Consequently, mapping key computing mechanisms of the slime mould onto 
      silicon would allow us to produce efficient bio-inspired computing devices to tackle 
      with hard to solve computational intelligence problems like the aforementioned. 
      Toward this direction, a cellular automaton (CA)-based, Physarum-inspired, network 
      designing model is proposed. This novel CA-based model is inspired by the 
      propagating strategy, the formation of tubular networks, and the computing abilities 
      of the plasmodium of P. polycephalum. The results delivered by the CA model 
      demonstrate a good match with several previously published results of experimental 
      laboratory studies on imitation of man-made transport networks with P. polycephalum. 
      Consequently, the proposed CA model can be used as a virtual, easy-to-access, and 
      biomimicking laboratory emulator that will economize large time periods needed for 
      biological experiments while producing networks almost identical to the tubular 
      networks of the real-slime mould.

TI  - Irrational decision-making in an amoeboid organism: transitivity and 
      context-dependent preferences.
PG  - 307-12
LID - 10.1098/rspb.2010.1045 [doi]
AB  - Most models of animal foraging and consumer choice assume that individuals make 
      choices based on the absolute value of items and are therefore 'economically 
      rational'. However, frequent violations of rationality by animals, including humans, 
      suggest that animals use comparative valuation rules. Are comparative valuation 
      strategies a consequence of the way brains process information, or are they an 
      intrinsic feature of biological decision-making? Here, we examine the principles of 
      rationality in an organism with radically different information-processing 
      mechanisms: the brainless, unicellular, slime mould Physarum polycephalum. We 
      offered P. polycephalum amoebas a choice between food options that varied in food 
      quality and light exposure (P. polycephalum is photophobic). The use of an absolute 
      valuation rule will lead to two properties: transitivity and independence of 
      irrelevant alternatives (IIA). Transitivity is satisfied if preferences have a 
      consistent, linear ordering, while IIA states that a decision maker's preference for 
      an item should not change if the choice set is expanded. A violation of either of 
      these principles suggests the use of comparative rather than absolute valuation 
      rules. Physarum polycephalum satisfied transitivity by having linear preference 
      rankings. However, P. polycephalum's preference for a focal alternative increased 
      when a third, inferior quality option was added to the choice set, thus violating 
      IIA and suggesting the use of a comparative valuation process. The discovery of 
      comparative valuation rules in a unicellular organism suggests that comparative 
      valuation rules are ubiquitous, if not universal, among biological decision makers.

AB  - Wavelike patterns driving transport are ubiquitous in life. Peristaltic pumps are a 
      paradigm of efficient mass transport by contraction driven flows-often limited by 
      energetic constraints. We show that a cost-efficient increase in pumping performance 
      can be achieved by modulating the phase difference between harmonics to increase 
      occlusion. In experiments we find a phase difference shift in the living peristalsis 
      model P. polycephalum as dynamic response to forced mass transport. Our findings 
      provide a novel metric for wavelike patterns and demonstrate the crucial role of 
      nonlinearities in life.

TI  - The crystal structure of the Physarum polycephalum actin-fragmin kinase: an atypical 
      protein kinase with a specialized substrate-binding domain.
PG  - 2923-9
AB  - Coordinated temporal and spatial regulation of the actin cytoskeleton is essential 
      for diverse cellular processes such as cell division, cell motility and the 
      formation and maintenance of specialized structures in differentiated cells. In 
      plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum, the F-actin capping activity of the 
      actin-fragmin complex is regulated by the phosphorylation of actin. This is mediated 
      by a novel type of protein kinase with no sequence homology to eukaryotic-type 
      protein kinases. Here we present the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of 
      the first cloned actin kinase in complex with AMP at 2.9 A resolution. The 
      three-dimensional fold reveals a catalytic module of approximately 160 residues, in 
      common with the eukaryotic protein kinase superfamily, which harbours the nucleotide 
      binding site and the catalytic apparatus in an inter-lobe cleft. Several kinases 
      that share this catalytic module differ in the overall architecture of their 
      substrate recognition domain. The actin-fragmin kinase has acquired a unique flat 
      substrate recognition domain which is supposed to confer stringent substrate 
      specificity.

AB  - Messenger RNA levels of three ras-family genes (Ppras1, Ppras2, and Pprap1) were 
      measured in different life forms and throughout the cell cycle of the slime mold 
      Physarum polycephalum. All three genes are expressed at constant rates in the 
      uninucleate amoebae and flagellates, regardless of the culture conditions (solid or 
      liquid medium, particulate or dissolved nutrients). In the multinucleate stages 
      (micro- and macroplasmodia) Ppras1 and Pprap1 mRNAs are somewhat less abundant, 
      while Ppras2 is not expressed at all. The early stages of the amoeba-plasmodium 
      transition proceed without any drop in Ppras2 expression. During the synchronous 
      cell cycle in macroplasmodia Ppras1 and Pprap1 are expressed at a constant level.

TI  - Potential sites for the perception of gravity in the acellular slime mold Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 75-8
AB  - Recently a gravisensitivity of the acellular slime mold Physarum polycephalum, which 
      possesses no specialized gravireceptor, could be established by conducting 
      experiments under simulated and under real near weightlessness. In these experiments 
      macroplasmodia showed a modulation of their contraction rhythm followed by 
      regulation phenomena. Until now the perception mechanism for the gravistimulus is 
      unknown, but several findings indicate the involvement of mitochondria: A) During 
      the impediment of respiration the 0g-reaction is inhibited and the regulation is 
      reduced. B) The response to a light stimulus and the following regulation phenomena 
      strongly resemble the behavior during exposure to 0g, the only difference is that 
      the two reactions are directed into opposite directions. In the blue-light reaction 
      a flavin of the mitochondrial matrix seems to be involved in the light perception. 
      C) The contraction rhythm as well as its modulations are coupled to rhythmic changes 
      in the levels of ATP and calcium ions, involving the mitochondria as sites of energy 
      production and of Ca(++)-storage. So the mitochondria could be the site of the 
      regulation and they possibly are the receptor sites for the light and gravity 
      stimuli. Also the observation of a morphologic polarity of the slime mold's 
      plasmodial strands has to be considered: Cross-sections reveal that the ectoplasmic 
      wall surrounding the streaming endoplasm is much thinner on the physically lower 
      side than on the upper side of the strand--this applies to strands lying on or 
      hanging on a horizontal surface. So, in addition to the mitochondria, also the 
      morphologic polarity may be involved in the perception mechanism of the observed 
      gravisensitivity and of the recently established geotaxis. The potential role of the 
      nuclei and of the contractile elements in the perception of gravity is also 
      discussed.

TI  - A photoreceptor with characteristics of phytochrome triggers sporulation in the true

PG  - 146-8
AB  - Phytochrome is a ubiquitous photoreceptor in plants that controls a variety of 
      responses to light, including gene expression, differential cell growth and 
      intracellular movement of organelles. All phytochromes analysed so far are 
      reversibly interconverted by light between an inactive and an active conformation, 
      each of which has a different and characteristic absorbance spectrum. Based on 
      photophysiological measurements we provide evidence, that a photoreceptor with these 
      unique properties of phytochrome triggers sporulation in the true slime mould 
      Physarum polycephalum.

TI  - Purification and characterization of the plasmodial phosphatase that hydrolyses the

PG  - 827-35
LID - 10.1042/CBI20090340 [doi]
AB  - A phosphatase was purified through a combination of ion-exchange and hydrophobic 
      chromatography followed by native PAGE from Physarum plasmodia. Recently, we 
      demonstrated that this phosphatase isoform has a hydrolytic activity towards the 
      PMLC (phosphorylated light chain of Physarum myosin II) at pH 7.6. The apparent 
      molecular mass of the purified enzyme was estimated at approximately 50 kDa by means 
      of analytical gel filtration. The enzyme was purified 340-fold to a final 
      phosphatase activity of 400 pkat/mg of protein. Among the phosphorylated compounds 
      tested for hydrolytic activity at pH 7.6, the enzyme showed no activity towards 
      nucleotides. At pH 7.6, hydrolytic activity of the enzyme against PMLC was detected; 
      at pH 5.0, however, no hydrolytic activity towards PMLC was observed. The Km of the 
      enzyme for PMLC was 10 microM, and the V(max) was 1.17 nkat/mg of protein. Ca(2+) 
      (10 microM) inhibited the activity of the enzyme, and Mg(2+) (8.5 microM) activated 
      the dephosphorylation of PMLC. Mn(2+) (1.6 microM) highly stimulated the enzyme's 
      activity. Based on these results, we concluded that the enzyme is likely to be a 
      phosphatase with hydrolytic activity towards PMLC.

TI  - Activation of the transcription of Gal4-regulated genes by Physarum 14-3-3 in yeast 
      is related to dimer-binding motif-2 and three phosphorylation sites.
PG  - 33-40
LID - 10.1007/s00203-009-0526-3 [doi]
AB  - The roles of 14-3-3 proteins in the lower eukaryotes are still elusive. We isolated 
      a cDNA encoding the 14-3-3 protein (P14-3-3) from the lower eukaryote Physarum 
      polycephalum. This P14-3-3 gene was then inserted downstream of the Gal4 DNA-binding 
      domain in the yeast expression vector pGBKT7. The recombinant vector was transformed 
      into auxotrophic AH109 and Y187 yeast cells to detect the activation of 
      Gal4-regulated gene expression mediated by P14-3-3. The results showed that three 
      reporter genes (ADE2, HIS3, and lacZ) could be normally expressed, indicating that 
      the transcriptional activation function of P14-3-3 was retained. We subsequently 
      used a truncated P14-3-3 peptides and mutant peptides to study the activation of the 
      Gal4-regulated genes ADE2, HIS3, and lacZ. We found that deletion of the N-terminal 
      second dimer-binding motif (DBM2) sequence or the C-terminal coil sequence led to 
      the loss of P14-3-3's transcriptional activation function. Specifically, any 
      mutation at the potential phosphorylation sites (Ser62 and Ser67) on DBM2 or at the 
      C-terminal potential phosphorylation site (235ThrSer236) led to the loss of the 
      transcriptional activation function of P14-3-3. Taken together, these observations 
      suggest that the transcriptional activation function of P14-3-3 in lower eukaryotes 
      is related to DBM2 and the C-terminal coil structures.

TI  - Characterization of the self-splicing products of a mobile intron from the nuclear 
      rDNA of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 5899-906
AB  - We have characterized the splicing products formed in vitro from RNA derived from 
      the mobile group I intron in the nuclear rDNA of Physarum polycephalum, Pp LSU 3. 
      This intron is a close relative of the well known Tetrahymena intron Tt LSU 1, being 
      inserted at exactly the same position in the rDNA and sharing about 90% sequence 
      identity with Tt LSU 1 in the conserved elements characteristic of the catalytic 
      core of all group I introns. However, Pp LSU 3 differs from Tt LSU 1 in that it 
      encodes a site-specific endonuclease, which mediates the homing of the intron to 
      unoccupied target sites. The endonuclease, I-Ppo, would appear to be a unique 
      example of a protein encoded by an RNA polymerase I transcript. To gain clues to the 
      splicing products formed in vivo, and to the nature of the messenger RNA for I-Ppo, 
      we subjected Pp LSU 3 RNA to standard self-splicing conditions in vitro, and then 
      analyzed the products by size, by northern blotting, and by primer extension. The 
      results show two novel features. First, in addition to the expected 5' splice site, 
      there is an alternative 5' splice site in the upstream exon, just preceding the 
      first codon of the I-Ppo open reading frame. Second, at the position corresponding 
      to the major circularization site in Tt LSU 1 there is an internal processing site, 
      leading to the efficient separation of two halves of the excised intron, the 5' half 
      encoding I-Ppo and 3' half containing the ribozyme. Surprisingly, this cleavage 
      appears not to be due to circularization followed by hydrolytic opening of the 
      circle, but rather to G addition. The formation of these products in vitro suggests 
      how the messenger RNA for the I-Ppo endonuclease may be generated in vivo.

TI  - Behavior of phosphatase isoforms during sclerotium formation in Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 485-91
AB  - The behavior of phosphatase isoforms under dark-starvation from plasmodium of 
      Physarum polycephalum were investigated to determine their possible roles in 
      sclerotium formation. Two and a half days after dark-starvation, approximately 95% 
      of plasmodia plates formed sclerotia. Specific phosphatase activity increased 
      markedly up to ca. two-fold within the first day of starvation, after which the 
      enzymatic activity decreased rapidly to a level less than the initial level within 2 
      days of the starvation period. Among the two isoforms of enzyme detected just before 
      sclerotization under dark-starvation conditions, the enzymatic activity of the major 
      isoform (Rm value of 0.6) decreased gradually within 1.5 days of starvation, then 
      linearly to less than 20% of that at the beginning of the observation. Those of 
      other major isoform (Rm value of 0.7) increased up to ca. two-fold within the first 
      day of starvation, then decreased linearly to levels less than that of the first 2 
      days of the starvation period. Behavior of this isoform strongly suggests that it 
      initiates the formation of sclerotium under dark-starvation conditions.

LID - 10.1126/science.1177894 [doi]
AB  - Transport networks are ubiquitous in both social and biological systems. Robust 
      network performance involves a complex trade-off involving cost, transport 
      efficiency, and fault tolerance. Biological networks have been honed by many cycles 
      of evolutionary selection pressure and are likely to yield reasonable solutions to 
      such combinatorial optimization problems. Furthermore, they develop without 
      centralized control and may represent a readily scalable solution for growing 
      networks in general. We show that the slime mold Physarum polycephalum forms 
      networks with comparable efficiency, fault tolerance, and cost to those of 
      real-world infrastructure networks--in this case, the Tokyo rail system. The core 
      mechanisms needed for adaptive network formation can be captured in a biologically 
      inspired mathematical model that may be useful to guide network construction in 
      other domains.

PG  - 761-72
AB  - Nuclei in G2 phase of the slime mold Physarum polycephalum, when transplanted, by 
      plasmodial coalescence, into an S-phase plasmodium, failed to start another round of 
      DNA synthesis. In the reciprocal combination, S-phase nuclei in a G2-phase host 
      continued DNA synthesis for several hours without appreciable decrease in rate. It 
      is suggested that the beginning of DNA replication is determined by an event, either 
      during or shortly after mitosis, which renders the chromosomes structurally 
      competent for DNA replication.

TI  - The mitochondrial plasmid of the true slime mold Physarum polycephalum bypasses 
      uniparental inheritance by promoting mitochondrial fusion.
PG  - 103-14
AB  - Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is inherited maternally in most eukaryotes. Linear 
      mitochondrial plasmids in higher plants and fungi are also transmitted from the 
      maternal parent to the progeny. However, mF, which is a mitochondrial linear plasmid 
      of Physarum polycephalum, evades uniparental mitochondrial inheritance. We examined 
      36 myxamoebal strains of Physarum and isolated three novel mF+ strains (JE8, TU111, 
      NG111) that harbored free mF plasmids. These strains were mated with the mF- strain 
      KM88. Of the three mF- x mF+ crosses, only KM88 x JE8 displayed complete uniparental 
      inheritance. However, in KM88 x TU111 and KM88 x NG111, the mtDNA of KM88 and mF of 
      TU111 and NG111 were inherited by the plasmodia and showed recombination. For 
      example, although the mtDNA of TU111 was eliminated, the mF of TU111 persisted and 
      became inserted into the mtDNA of KM88, such that recombinant mtDNA represented 80% 
      of the total mtDNA. The parental mitochondria fused to yield giant mitochondria with 
      two or more mitochondrial nucleoids. The mF appears to exchange mitochondria from 
      the recipient (paternal) to the donor (maternal) by promoting mitochondrial fusion.

TI  - Theory of time-resolved somatic complementation and its use to explore the 
      sporulation control network in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 105-15
AB  - Mutants of Physarum polycephalum can be complemented by fusion of plasmodial cells 
      followed by cytoplasmic mixing. Complementation between strains carrying different 
      mutational defects in the sporulation control network may depend on the signaling 
      state of the network components. We have previously suggested that time-resolved 
      somatic complementation (TRSC) analysis with such mutants may be used to probe 
      network architecture and dynamics. By computer simulation it is now shown how and 
      under which conditions the regulatory hierarchy of genes can be determined 
      experimentally. A kinetic model of the sporulation control network is developed, 
      which is then used to demonstrate how the mechanisms of TRSC can be understood and 
      simulated at the kinetic level. On the basis of theoretical considerations, 
      experimental parameters that determine whether functional complementation of two 
      mutations will occur are identified. It is also shown how gene dosage-effect 
      relationships can be employed for network analysis. The theoretical framework 
      provided may be used to systematically analyze network structure and dynamics 
      through time-resolved somatic complementation studies. The conclusions drawn are of

TI  - The DNA-polymerase inhibiting activity of poly(beta-l-malic acid) in nuclear extract 
      during the cell cycle of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 1253-8
AB  - The naturally synchronous plasmodia of myxomycetes synthesize poly(beta-l-malic 
      acid), which carries out cell-specific functions. In Physarum polycephalum, 
      poly(beta-l-malate) [the salt form of poly(beta-l-malic acid)] is highly 
      concentrated in the nuclei, repressing DNA synthetic activity of DNA polymerases by 
      the formation of reversible complexes. To test whether this inhibitory activity is 
      cell-cycle-dependent, purified DNA polymerase alpha of P. polycephalum was added to 
      the nuclear extract and the activity was measured by the incorporation of 
      [3H]thymidine 5'-monophosphate into acid precipitable nick-activated salmon testis 
      DNA. Maximum DNA synthesis by the reporter was measured in S-phase, equivalent to a 
      minimum of inhibitory activity. To test for the activity of endogenous DNA 
      polymerases, DNA synthesis was followed by the highly sensitive photoaffinity 
      labeling technique. Labeling was observed in S-phase in agreement with the minimum 
      of the inhibitory activity. The activity was constant throughout the cell cycle when 
      the inhibition was neutralized by the addition of spermidine hydrochloride. Also, 
      the concentration of poly(beta-l-malate) did not vary with the phase of the cell 
      cycle [Schmidt, A., Windisch, C. & Holler, E. (1996) Nuclear accumulation and 
      homeostasis of the unusual polymer poly(beta-l-malate) in plasmodia of Physarum 
      polycephalum. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 70, 373-380]. To explain the variation in the cell 
      cycle, a periodic competition for poly(beta-l-malate) between DNA polymerases and 
      most likely certain histones was assumed. These effectors are synthesized in 
      S-phase. By competition they displace DNA polymerase from the complex of 
      poly(beta-l-malate). The free polymerases, which are no longer inhibited, engage in 
      DNA synthesis. It is speculated that poly(beta-l-malate) is active in maintaining 
      mitotic synchrony of plasmodia by playing the mediator between the periodic 
      synthesis of certain proteins and the catalytic competence of DNA polymerases.

TI  - Amoeboid organism solves complex nutritional challenges.
PG  - 4607-11
LID - 10.1073/pnas.0912198107 [doi]
AB  - A fundamental question in nutritional biology is how distributed systems maintain an 
      optimal supply of multiple nutrients essential for life and reproduction. In the 
      case of animals, the nutritional requirements of the cells within the body are 
      coordinated by the brain in neural and chemical dialogue with sensory systems and 
      peripheral organs. At the level of an insect society, the requirements for the 
      entire colony are met by the foraging efforts of a minority of workers responding to 
      cues emanating from the brood. Both examples involve components specialized to deal 
      with nutrient supply and demand (brains and peripheral organs, foragers and brood). 
      However, some of the most species-rich, largest, and ecologically significant 
      heterotrophic organisms on earth, such as the vast mycelial networks of fungi, 
      comprise distributed networks without specialized centers: How do these organisms 
      coordinate the search for multiple nutrients? We address this question in the 
      acellular slime mold Physarum polycephalum and show that this extraordinary organism 
      can make complex nutritional decisions, despite lacking a coordination center and 
      comprising only a single vast multinucleate cell. We show that a single slime mold 
      is able to grow to contact patches of different nutrient quality in the precise 
      proportions necessary to compose an optimal diet. That such organisms have the 
      capacity to maintain the balance of carbon- and nitrogen-based nutrients by 
      selective foraging has considerable implications not only for our understanding of 
      nutrient balancing in distributed systems but for the functional ecology of soils, 
      nutrient cycling, and carbon sequestration.

TI  - A universal optimization strategy for ant colony optimization algorithms based on 
      the Physarum-inspired mathematical model.
PG  - 036006
LID - 10.1088/1748-3182/9/3/036006 [doi]
AB  - Ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithms often fall into the local optimal solution 
      and have lower search efficiency for solving the travelling salesman problem (TSP). 
      According to these shortcomings, this paper proposes a universal optimization 
      strategy for updating the pheromone matrix in the ACO algorithms. The new 
      optimization strategy takes advantages of the unique feature of critical paths 
      reserved in the process of evolving adaptive networks of the Physarum-inspired 
      mathematical model (PMM). The optimized algorithms, denoted as PMACO algorithms, can 
      enhance the amount of pheromone in the critical paths and promote the exploitation 
      of the optimal solution. Experimental results in synthetic and real networks show 
      that the PMACO algorithms are more efficient and robust than the traditional ACO 
      algorithms, which are adaptable to solve the TSP with single or multiple objectives. 
      Meanwhile, we further analyse the influence of parameters on the performance of the 
      PMACO algorithms. Based on these analyses, the best values of these parameters are 
      worked out for the TSP.

TI  - Calcium and malate are sporulation-promoting factors of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 6900-5
AB  - Fruiting body formation (sporulation) is a distinctive, irreversible differentiation 
      process in the life cycle of the slime mold Physarum polycephalum. The most 
      important requirement for sporulation of Physarum is a period of starvation, and 
      normally sporulation proceeds in the light. It is shown here that by omitting the 
      liquid sporulation medium and elevating the temperature from 21 to 25 degrees C, 
      sporulation can occur routinely in the dark. It is further shown that this autocrine 
      signaling in the dark requires calcium ions and malate. A putative sporulation 
      control factor was detected in conditioned media derived from plasmodia starved in 
      the dark, which was then identified as polymalate. As an additional role for this 
      previously detected polyanion, specific for the plasmodial state of Physarum, it is 
      suggested that the secreted compound serves as a source for both malate and calcium 
      ions and thus promotes sporulation without light signaling.

TI  - Histone acetyltransferases during the cell cycle and differentiation of Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 102-10
AB  - The dynamic state of histone acetylation is maintained by histone acetyltransferases 
      (HATs) and deacetylases. Cellular fractionation of plasmodia of Physarum 
      polycephalum and partial purification of subcellular fractions by chromatography 
      revealed the existence of a cytoplasmic B-type and four nuclear A-type HATs. The 
      cytoplasmic B-enzyme was highly specific for histone H4, causing di-acetylation of 
      H4 in vitro. The nuclear enzymes (HAT-A1 to HAT-A4) accepted all core histones as 
      substrates, but differed by the preference for certain histone species. Enzymes were 
      analyzed during the naturally synchronous cell cycle of macroplasmodia. Each of the 
      enzymes had its individual cell cycle activity pattern, indicating diverse functions 
      in nuclear metabolism. When growing plasmodia were induced to undergo 
      differentiation into dormant sclerotia, an additional enzyme (HAT-AS) appeared at a 
      late stage of sclerotization which correlated with differentiation-specific histone 
      synthesis and acetylation in the absence of DNA replication. When dormant sclerotia 
      were induced to reenter the cell cycle, a further enzyme form (HAT-AG) appeared 
      during a short time period prior to the first post-germination mitosis. This enzyme 
      had a strong preference for H2B, correlating with the overproportional in vivo 
      acetate incorporation in H2B. Both differentiation-associated HATs were undetectable 
      in growing plasmodia. The results demonstrate that different functions of core 
      histone acetylation are based on multiple enzyme forms that are independently 
      regulated during the cell cycle. Transitions from one developmental stage into 
      another are accompanied by specific enzyme forms. With respect to recent data in the 
      literature it may be assumed that these HAT-forms are subunits of a HAT-complex 
      whose composition changes during the cell cycle and differentiation.

PG  - 69-74
AB  - The production of beta-poly(L-malate) (PMLA) by non-growing microplasmodia of 
      Physarum polycephalum was investigated. Growth was minimal in culture medium devoid 
      of nitrogen source, but PMLA production occurred at a substantial rate. The addition 
      of metabolic intermediates, malate, fumarate, succinate, and oxaloacetate, and the 
      omission of hematin showed considerable growth inhibition in the presence of the 
      nitrogen source, while PMLA production per unit biomass increased significantly. The 
      results indicated that PMLA production was dissociated from biomass production under 
      these conditions. The stimulating effect of carbonate on PMLA production was 
      independent on growth. Cultivation in the absence of the nitrogen source and hematin 
      or in the presence of the metabolites may be a useful technique for efficient PMLA 
      production at a minimum of biomass production.

TI  - DNA replication-dependent formation of joint DNA molecules in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 971-80
AB  - Two-dimensional neutral/neutral agarose gel electrophoresis is used extensively to 
      localize replication origins. This method resolves DNA structures containing 
      replication forks. It also detects X-shaped recombination intermediates in meiotic 
      cells, in the form of a typical vertical spike. Intriguingly, such a spike of joint 
      DNA molecules is often detectable in replicating DNA from mitotic cells. Here, we 
      used naturally synchronous DNA samples from Physarum polycephalum to demonstrate 
      that postreplicative, DNA replication-dependent X-shaped DNA molecules are formed 
      between sister chromatids. These molecules have physical properties reminiscent of 
      Holliday junctions. Our results demonstrate frequent interactions between sister 
      chromatids during a normal cell cycle and suggest a novel phase during DNA 
      replication consisting of transient, joint DNA molecules formed on newly replicated 
      DNA.

TI  - Chromatin remodeling by cell cycle stage-specific extracts from Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 214-20
AB  - Remodeling of chromatin is an essential process allowing the establishment of 
      specific genetic programs. The slime mold Physarum polycephalum presents the 
      attractive advantage of natural synchrony of the cell cycle in several million 
      nuclei. Whole-cell extracts prepared at precise stages during the cell cycle were 
      tested for the ability to induce remodeling in erythrocyte nuclei as monitored by 
      microscopy, protamine competition assays, micrococcal nuclease digestions, and 
      release of histone H5. Extracts derived from two specific cell cycle stages caused 
      opposite types of changes in erythrocyte nuclei. An increase in chromatin compaction 
      was imparted by extracts prepared during S-phase while extracts harvested at the end 
      of G2-phase caused increases in nuclear volume, DNA accessibility, and release of 
      linker histone. We also found that late G2 extracts had the ability to alter the 
      DNase I digestion profile of mononucleosomes reconstituted in vitro in a classical 
      nucleosomes remodeling assay. The relevance of these finding to the Physarum cell 
      cycle is discussed.

TI  - Genetic organization of a linear mitochondrial plasmid (mF) that promotes 
      mitochondrial fusion in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 506-11
AB  - The mF plasmid which promotes mitochondrial fusion in Physarum polycephalum is a 
      linear molecule with complex terminal inverted repeats (TIRs). Its nucleotide 
      sequence was determined. The mF plasmid is 14,503 bp in size, and contains ten open 
      reading frames (ORFs). All of the ORFs except one are encoded on the same DNA strand 
      (coding strand). The number of amino-acid residues in the putative proteins derived 
      from the nine ORFs on the coding strand are 231, 163, 640, 235, 118, 1130, 366, 309, 
      and 547 from left (5' end) to right (3' end) on the map. The amino-acid sequences of 
      newly-identified ORFs on the mF plasmid did not show significant homology to any 
      amino-acid sequences in the databases. A brief transcriptional map of the mF plasmid 
      was constructed, and the following features were noted. (1) The transcription 
      initiation site was located just inside the end of the left TIRs, but not within the 
      TIRs themselves. (2) Three major transcripts of 1.0, 3.4 and 4.6 knt corresponded to 
      the left region of the mF plasmid, and long, low-abundance (more than 4.6 knt), 
      heterogenous transcripts corresponded to almost the entire mF plasmid. A 
      low-abundance, 3.5-knt transcript corresponding to the coding region of ORF1 130 (a 
      1 130-amino-acid polypeptide) was also detected, and may be derived from the long 
      transcripts. (3) The quantity of transcripts which included the region near the 
      transcription initiation site was about 500-times more than that which included the 
      region near the inner end of the right TIRs.

PG  - 046016

AB  - Because most networks are intrinsically directed, the directed shortest path problem 
      has been one of the fundamental issues in network optimization. In this paper, a 
      novel algorithm for finding the shortest path in directed networks is proposed. It 
      extends a bio-inspired path finding model of Physarum polycephalum, which is 
      designed only for undirected networks, by adopting analog circuit analysis. 
      Illustrative examples are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm 
      in finding the directed shortest path.

TI  - Direct transfer of learned behaviour via cell fusion in non-neural organisms.
LID - 10.1098/rspb.2016.2382 [doi]
LID - 20162382
AB  - Cell fusion is a fundamental phenomenon observed in all eukaryotes. Cells can 
      exchange resources such as molecules or organelles during fusion. In this paper, we 
      ask whether a cell can also transfer an adaptive response to a fusion partner. We 
      addressed this question in the unicellular slime mould Physarum polycephalum, in 
      which cell-cell fusion is extremely common. Slime moulds are capable of habituation, 
      a simple form of learning, when repeatedly exposed to an innocuous repellent, 
      despite lacking neurons and comprising only a single cell. In this paper, we present 
      a set of experiments demonstrating that slime moulds habituated to a repellent can 
      transfer this adaptive response by cell fusion to individuals that have never 
      encountered the repellent. In addition, we show that a slime mould resulting from 
      the fusion of a minority of habituated slime moulds and a majority of unhabituated 
      ones still shows an adaptive response to the repellent. Finally, we further reveal 
      that fusion must last a certain time to ensure an effective transfer of the 
      behavioural adaptation between slime moulds. Our results provide strong experimental 
      evidence that slime moulds exhibit transfer of learned behaviour during cell fusion 
      and raise the possibility that similar phenomena may occur in other cell-cell fusion 
      systems.

TI  - Purification, some properties, and primary structure of base non-specific 
      ribonucleases from Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 425-32
AB  - Two ribonucleases (RNase Phya and RNase Phyb) were purified to homogeneity on 
      SDS-PAGE from the culture filtrate of the fungus Physarum polycephalum. The apparent 
      molecular weights of RNases Phya and Phyb were about 20,000. The pH optima of these 
      two RNases were around 4.5-4.75. The RNases released mononucleotides from RNA in the 
      order of 3'-GMP, 3'-AMP, and 3'-pyrimidine nucleotides. RNase Phya and RNase Phyb 
      have the N-terminal amino acid sequences STSFD--- and KSTSF--, respectively. This 
      finding and the similar amino acid compositions of both RNases indicated that they 
      might share the same protein moiety except for the N-terminus Lys. The complete 
      primary structure of RNase Phyb was determined, mostly by analysis of the peptides 
      generated by trypsin, V8 protease, and lysylendopeptidase digestions. The molecular 
      weight of the protein moiety was 19,704. The locations of four half cystine residues 
      were almost superimposable on those in five known fungal RNase T2 family RNases, but 
      two others were not. The sequence homology between RNase Phyb and five known fungal 
      RNases amounted to 53-59 residues, which are concentrated around the three histidine 
      residues, supposed to form the active site in enzymes of the RNase T2 family. 
      However, the amino acid sequence of RNase Phyb more closely resembles those of plant 
      RNases such as RNases from Nicotiana alata [McClure, B.A. et al. (1989) Nature 342, 
      955-957], tomato [RNase Le, Yost et al. (1991) Eur. J. Biochem. 198, 1-6], and 
      Momoridica charantia [RNase MC1, Ide et al. (1991) FEBS Lett. 284, 161-164].

TI  - Slime moulds use heuristics based on within-patch experience to decide when to 
      leave.
PG  - 1175-9
LID - 10.1242/jeb.116533 [doi]
AB  - Animals foraging in patchy, non-renewing or slowly renewing environments must make 
      decisions about how long to remain within a patch. Organisms can use heuristics 
      ('rules of thumb') based on available information to decide when to leave the patch. 
      Here, we investigated proximate patch-departure heuristics in two species of giant, 
      brainless amoeba: the slime moulds Didymium bahiense and Physarum polycephalum. We 
      explicitly tested the importance of information obtained through experience by 
      eliminating chemosensory cues of patch quality. In P. polycephalum, patch departure 
      was influenced by the consumption of high, and to a much lesser extent low, quality 
      food items such that engulfing a food item increased patch-residency time. Physarum 
      polycephalum also tended to forage for longer in darkened, 'safe' patches. In D. 
      bahiense, engulfment of any food item increased patch residency irrespective of that 
      food item's quality. Exposure to light had no effect on the patch-residency time of 
      D. bahiense. Given that these organisms lack a brain, our results illustrate how the 
      use of simple heuristics can give the impression that individuals make sophisticated 
      foraging decisions.

TI  - Phase switching of oscillatory contraction in relation to the regulation of amoeboid 
      behavior by the plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 261-7
AB  - The plasmodium of the true slime mould Physarum polycephalum is a large aggregate of 
      protoplasm and behaves like an amoeboid cell, exhibiting rhythmic contraction 
      everywhere within the organism. Phase dynamics of these oscillations were studied in 
      relation to the global organization of amoeboid behavior, by analysing the thickness 
      oscillation, isotonic tension and the motive force of the streaming. Usually the 
      plasmodium showed synchrony, the phase of the oscillation being the same everywhere 
      excepting the peripheral part. We found several situations where this in-phase 
      relationship switched to anti-phase. This occurred either at the early stages of the 
      plasmodial coalescence, or when a single plasmodium was nearly separated by 
      partition, or when the streaming of the protoplasm was hindered by applying the 
      hydrostatic pressure. Furthermore, the motive force of the protoplasmic streaming 
      increased once the anti-phase relationship was established. In this way, the weak 
      interactions among plasmodial parts induce the switching of phase relationship from 
      in-phase to anti-phase, and this transition in turn acts to increase the interaction 
      by promoting a rapid mixing of the protoplasm. This global feedback mechanism by 
      phase switching should help maintain a large single plasmodium without separating 
      into parts. The possible mechanism of phase switching is discussed in terms of 
      coupled nonlinear oscillators.

TI  - Substitutional and insertional RNA editing of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 
      mRNA of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 25483-6
AB  - The term RNA editing encompasses two types of specific alterations in the coding 
      potential of RNA molecules: base substitution and the insertion (or deletion) of 
      nucleotides. Such changes in RNA sequence can have profound effects on gene 
      expression, and, indeed, most genes in the mitochondria of plants, trypanosomatids, 
      and Physarum appear to require editing for their expression. We describe here the 
      first instance of the utilization of both types of RNA editing in the processing of 
      a single mRNA, that of the mitochondrially encoded cytochrome oxidase subunit I of 
      the acellular slime mold, Physarum polycephalum. Editing of this mRNA includes the 
      insertion of cytidine, guanosine, and uridine residues, as well as the apparent 
      conversion of cytidines to uridines. No edited version of this gene was detected in 
      Physarum DNA, and amino acid alignments suggest that both types of RNA editing are 
      required to produce a functional protein.

TI  - In vitro DNA fragmentation of mitochondrial DNA caused by single-stranded breakage 
      related to macroplasmodial senescence of the true slime mold, Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 125-35
AB  - We found that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) isolated from Physarum polycephalum 
      fragmented itself in weak ionic solutions. The mtDNA was dissolved in STE (saline 
      Tris-EDTA: 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA), TE (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA) 
      and DW, and then electrophoresed in an agarose gel. The intact 86-kbp mtDNA band was 
      seen in STE, but several novel bands appeared in TE and DW. In TE, two discrete 
      bands appeared at 6.7-kbp (alpha-band) and 5.0-kbp (beta-band), whereas at least 17 
      discrete bands were observed in distilled water (DW). These fragmentation patterns 
      were not stoichiometric, as seen when using restriction endonucleases, but were 
      clearly different from the degradation of DNA caused by a physical shearing force or 
      a contaminating nuclease. In this paper, we characterize this in vitro fragmentation 
      of mtDNA from P. polycephalum. We located 19 fragments, including the alpha and beta 
      fragments, on a mtDNA restriction map, and demonstrated that these cleavage sites 
      were S1 nuclease-sensitive regions, which are single-stranded DNA regions such as 
      nicks and gaps in the mtDNA. The alpha and beta fragments are derived from the 
      region encoding ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and the ATP synthase (atpA) gene, while the 
      other 17 fragments are not derived from any specific region, but the cleavage sites 
      are located throughout the mtDNA molecule. In P. polycephalum, it is well known that 
      the growth rate of macroplasmodia decreases with aging. Equal amounts of mtDNA from 
      juvenile and aged macroplasmodia were electrophoresed and the frequency of the beta 
      fragment in each sample was measured. The ratio of the beta band to the total signal 
      including background was estimated to be 3.3-4.0% in juvenile macroplasmodia, 
      whereas it increased to 8.3-28.2% in aged macroplasmodia. This result suggests that 
      the in vitro fragmentation of mtDNA is associated with macroplasmodial senescence. 
      The single-stranded breakage of mtDNA of P. polycephalum may accumulate with age.

TI  - Molecular cloning, over-expression, developmental regulation and immunolocalization 
      of fragminP, a gelsolin-related actin-binding protein from Physarum polycephalum 
      plasmodia.
PG  - 1215-26
AB  - FragminP is a Ca2+-dependent actin-binding and microfilament regulatory protein of 
      the gelsolin family. We screened a Physarum polycephalum cDNA library with 
      polyclonal fragminP antibodies and isolated a cDNA clone of 1,104 bp encoding 368 
      amino acids of fragminP, revealing two consensus phosphatidylinositol 4,5 
      bisphosphate-binding motifs in the central part of the protein. The first methionine 
      is modified by an acetyl group, and three amino acids were missing from the protein 
      coded for by the cDNA clone. Full-length recombinant fragminP was generated by PCR, 
      purified after over-expression from Escherichia coli and displayed identical 
      properties to native Physarum fragminP. Northern blot analysis against RNA, isolated 
      from cultures at various stages of development, indicated that fragminP is absent 
      from amoebae and that expression is initiated at an early stage during apogamic 
      development, in a similar way to that observed for the profilin genes. In situ 
      immunolocalization of fragminP in Physarum microplasmodia revealed that the protein 
      is localized predominantly at the plasma membrane, suggesting a role in the 
      regulation of the subcortical actin meshwork. Our data indicate that we have 
      isolated the plasmodium-specific fragminP cDNA (frgP) and suggest that, in each of 
      its two vegetative cell types, P. polycephalum uses a different fragmin isoform that 
      performs different functions.

TI  - Cell cycle inhibitory effects of leaf extract from Curcuma vamana M. Sabu & Mangaly 
      on mitotically synchronous cultures of Physarum polycephalum Schw.
PG  - 81-7
AB  - Leaf extracts of C. vamana, endemic to Kerala state in India, were found to inhibit 
      cell cycle progression in synchronous cultures of P. polycephalum in a concentration 
      and phase-specific manner. Crude alkaloid extract (CAE) elicited maximum cell cycle 
      delays in comparison to soxhletted chloroform, acetone and aqueous extracts. Total 
      alkaloid content of CAE was found to be 64.9 mg/g. CAE showed lowest DPPH radical 
      scavenging activity. Other extracts with higher free radical scavenging activity 
      exhibited lesser cell cycle inhibiting potential. Upto 21% decrease in nuclear DNA 
      was observed in CAE treated samples. However, genotoxicity as evidenced by comet 
      assay was not observed. The extracts were also found to be non-toxic to human RBCs 
      at the highest concentration tested (750 microg/mL). CAE treatment completely 
      suppressed a 63 kDa polypeptide with a concomitant, but weak induction of a 60 kDa 
      polypeptide suggesting that these may be cell cycle related. CAE was found to 
      possess potent antiproliferative activity against PBLs. The study clearly 
      demonstrates the cell cycle inhibitory activity of C. vamana leaf extracts, with CAE 
      being the most potent of them.

TI  - Multiple polypeptides immunologically related to beta-poly(L-malate) hydrolase 
      (polymalatase) in the plasmodium of the slime mold Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 405-12
AB  - Plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum contain large amounts of the cell-type-specific 
      polyanion beta-poly(L-malate) and of a corresponding specific hydrolase 
      (polymalatase), both expressed in the plasmodial form of the organism. We have 
      partially purified polymalatase, the preparation consisting of several polypeptides, 
      which could not be separated without destroying the hydrolase activity. Polypeptides 
      of 68 kDa and 97 kDa were identified as polymalatases. Both were glycosylated, the 
      68-kDa form giving rise to a 54-kDa form when deglycosylated, and the 97-kDa form 
      giving rise to an 88-kDa polypeptide that was indistinguishable from an 88-kDa 
      inactive species also contained in the enzyme preparation. Antisera against each of 
      these proteins were used to detect the intracellular distribution of the proteins. 
      We found that the antisera crossreacted with the three proteins and, furthermore, 
      with a multiplicity of polypeptides ubiquitously distributed over the plasmodium. 
      Results of a two-dimensional non-denaturing in the first dimension and 
      SDS-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the second dimension suggested 
      that the proteins were derived from a 200-kDa 'precursor' protein by proteolytic 
      fragmentation. Polymalatase activity could be generated from a high molecular-mass 
      precursor. According to several pieces of evidence, the proteolytic nicking occurred 
      within plasmodia. The fragments were sticky and gave rise to preferred sizes of 
      nicked macromolecules. The observed multiplicity varied as a function of the age of 
      the cultures. The cellular distribution and the intracellular pH value were not 
      compatible with an in situ polymalatase activity and suggested other, presently 
      unknown, function(s) such as in the transportation of beta-poly(L-malate) from the 
      nucleus to the culture medium.

TI  - G1-phase arrest is not a prerequisite for encystment in Physarum.
PG  - 351-4
AB  - Amoebae of the Myxomycete Physarum polycephalum form resistant, walled cysts when 
      the food bacteria in a culture have been consumed. No G1 phase has been detected in 
      the vegetative amoebal cell cycle, most of which comprises the G2 phase. Mature 
      cysts are also in G2, but it has been reported that a G1 phase of roughly 24 h, 
      followed by an S phase, is obligatory prior to encystment. We used flow cytometry to 
      determine the distribution of DNA contents in amoebal cultures at intervals during 
      vegetative growth and encystment. In all cultures, the cells were predominantly in 
      G2 phase, and the percentage of cells with G1 DNA content remained very low. We 
      conclude that an extended G1 phase of 24 h did not occur in our cultures and cannot 
      be a prerequisite for encystment.

TI  - Nonmuscle caldesmon: its distribution and involvement in various cellular processes. 
      Review article.
PG  - 1-13
AB  - Smooth muscle caldesmon is a thin-filament constituent which takes part in the 
      Ca2+-dependent regulation of actomyosin motor activity which converts chemical 
      energy of ATP into force. The molecular anatomy of its counterpart found in a 
      variety of nonmuscle cells is similar. Both contain about 20 nm long terminal 
      domains responsible for functionally important multisite interactions with 
      filamentous actin, tropomyosin, Ca2+/calmodulin, and myosin and differ by a 35 nm 
      long central, alpha-helical fragment which is lacking in nonmuscle caldesmon. The 
      different structural organisation of nonmuscle cells and thus distinct distribution 
      of caldesmon implicates its different physiological functions. Due to direct 
      interaction with globular and filamentous actin as well as with tropomyosin, 
      nonmuscle caldesmon is involved in the assembly, dynamics, or stability of 
      microfilaments, whereas the indirect inhibitory effect on interaction of the 
      microfilaments with myosin causes its participation in the regulation of cell 
      contraction and intracellular motional processes. These functions of nonmuscle 
      caldesmon of vertebrates are controlled by Ca2+/calmodulin (or other Ca2+-binding 
      proteins) or caldesmon phosphorylation catalysed by various protein kinases. 
      Examples of nonmuscle caldesmon involvement in functions of higher and lower 
      eukaryote, animal and plant cells are presented.

TI  - Identification, partial sequence and genetic analysis of mlpA, a novel gene encoding 
      a myosin-related protein in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 114-21
AB  - Studies of motility in Physarum polycephalum have concentrated on the well-defined 
      actomyosin system in plasmodia. It is clear from recent genetic studies in lower 
      eukaryotes that myosin is involved in a number of physiological processes in 
      addition to the contractile functions previously ascribed to the classical type II 
      myosins. Moreover, the myosin protein family has proved to be more complex than 
      anticipated, with an increasing number of reported specialized isoforms. Although a 
      myosin type II activity has been identified in both amoebae and plasmodia of P. 
      polycephalum, and it has been inferred that these proteins undergo a phase-specific 
      isoform switch during development, this phenomenon has not been analysed 
      genetically. In an effort to understand the putative developmental expression of 
      actomyosin-associated proteins, we isolated a 180-kDa protein from amoebae which is 
      highly enriched, along with actin and myosin, in actomyosin preparations in the 
      presence of mM concentrations of Mg++ ions and 10 mM of ATP. Using polyclonal 
      antisera raised against pl80 we have cloned and sequenced a partial cDNA encoding a 
      protein whose predicted amino-acid sequence indicates some similarity with the 
      Dictyostelium discoideum myosin heavy-chain tail domain. Southern-blot and RFLP 
      analyses indicate that the gene involved, designated mlpA (myosin-like protein), 
      occurs in a single copy in the genome, is a novel Physarum gene and is expressed 
      during amoebal and plasmodial growth and in the dormant forms of both these cell 
      types.

AB  - Over the last few years, an increasing number of publications has shown that living 
      organisms are very effective in finding solutions to complex mathematical problems 
      which usually demand large computation resources. The plasmodium of the slime mould 
      Physarum polycephalum is a successful example that has been used to solve 
      path-finding problems on graphs and combinatorial problems. Cellular automata (CAs) 
      computational model can capture the essential features of systems in which global 
      behavior emerges from the collective effect of simple components, which interact 
      locally (emergent computation). We developed a CA that models exactly the Physarum's 
      behavior and applied it in finding the minimum-length path between two points in a 
      labyrinth, as well as in solving a path-planning problem by guiding the development 
      of adaptive networks, as in the case of the actual rail network of Tokyo. The CA 
      results are in very good agreement with the computation results produced by the 
      living organism experiments in both cases. Moreover, our CA hardware implementation 
      results in faster and more effective computation performance, because of its 
      inherent parallel nature. Consequently, our CA, implemented both in software and 
      hardware, can serve as a powerful and low-cost virtual laboratory that models the 
      slime mould Physarum's computation behavior.

TI  - Cell cycle-dependent activation of telomerase in naturally synchronized culture of a 
      true slime mold, Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 492-6
AB  - Telomeres of Physarum plasmodia did not shorten with numerous repeats of nuclear 
      division, and an apparent activity of telomerase was detected in this organism. In 
      naturally synchronized culture of Physarum plasmodia, an evident activation of 
      telomerase was observed at the late S-phase, just prior to the completion of in vivo 
      DNA replication, and the low telomerase activity was detected throughout the cell 
      cycle. In the nuclei isolated from different phases of synchronized plasmodia, a 
      higher activity of telomerase was also observed at late S-phase. These results 
      clearly show the existence of a cell cycle-dependent regulatory mechanism of 
      telomerase activity in growing, naturally synchronized cells.

TI  - Glom is a novel mitochondrial DNA packaging protein in Physarum polycephalum and 
      causes intense chromatin condensation without suppressing DNA functions.
PG  - 4758-69
AB  - Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is packed into highly organized structures called 
      mitochondrial nucleoids (mt-nucleoids). To understand the organization of mtDNA and 
      the overall regulation of its genetic activity within the mt-nucleoids, we 
      identified and characterized a novel mtDNA packaging protein, termed Glom (a protein 
      inducing agglomeration of mitochondrial chromosome), from highly condensed 
      mt-nucleoids of the true slime mold, Physarum polycephalum. This protein could bind 
      to the entire mtDNA and package mtDNA into a highly condensed state in vitro. 
      Immunostaining analysis showed that Glom specifically localized throughout the 
      mt-nucleoid. Deduced amino acid sequence revealed that Glom has a lysine-rich region 
      with proline-rich domain in the N-terminal half and two HMG boxes in C-terminal 
      half. Deletion analysis of Glom revealed that the lysine-rich region was sufficient 
      for the intense mtDNA condensation in vitro. When the recombinant Glom proteins 
      containing the lysine-rich region were expressed in Escherichia coli, the condensed 
      nucleoid structures were observed in E. coli. Such in vivo condensation did not 
      interfere with transcription or replication of E. coli chromosome and the 
      proline-rich domain was essential to keep those genetic activities. The expression 
      of Glom also complemented the E. coli mutant lacking the bacterial histone-like 
      protein HU and the HMG-boxes region of Glom was important for the complementation. 
      Our results suggest that Glom is a new mitochondrial histone-like protein having a 
      property to cause intense DNA condensation without suppressing DNA functions.

TI  - Slime mold solves maze in one pass, assisted by gradient of chemo-attractants.

AB  - Plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum is a large cell, visible by unaided eye, which 
      exhibits sophisticated patterns of foraging behaviour. The plasmodium's behaviour is 
      well interpreted in terms of computation, where data are spatially extended 
      configurations of nutrients and obstacles, and results of computation are networks 
      of protoplasmic tubes formed by the plasmodium. In laboratory experiments and 
      numerical simulation we show that if plasmodium of P. polycephalum is inoculated in 
      a maze's peripheral channel and an oat flake (source of attractants) in a the maze's 
      central chamber then the plasmodium grows toward target oat flake and connects the 
      flake with the site of original inoculation with a pronounced protoplasmic tube. The 
      protoplasmic tube represents a path in the maze. The plasmodium solves maze in one 
      pass because it is assisted by a gradient of chemo-attractants propagating from the 
      target oat flake.

TI  - Inhibition of eukaryotic DNA polymerase alpha with a novel lysophosphatidic acid 
      (PHYLPA) isolated from myxoamoebae of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 21512-7
AB  - A specific inhibitor of DNA polymerase alpha was isolated from the lipid fraction 
      prepared from myxoamoebae of a true slime mold, Physarum polycephalum. The purified 
      substance was subjected to structural studies by fast atom bombardment mass 
      spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance 
      spectroscopy. The structure of this substance was thereby suggested to be a novel 
      lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) composed of cyclic phosphate and cyclopropane-containing 
      hexadecanoic acid. Then we named this substance PHYLPA (Physarum LPA). PHYLPA 
      inhibited more than 80% of the affinity-purified calf thymus DNA polymerase alpha 
      activity at a concentration of 10 micrograms/ml (approximately 20 microM). 
      Inhibition was observed for DNA polymerase alpha but not for DNA polymerase beta or 
      gamma from various eukaryotic species, nor did it inhibit DNA polymerase I from E. 
      coli. From kinetic analyses, the inhibition was considered to be caused by the 
      interaction of PHYLPA with the template DNA.

AB  - A plurality of whole cell biosensors have been developed using many different cell 
      types. Biosensors incorporate biomolecular components or whole cells to facilitate 
      specific analyte interaction; research documented here presents a novel whole cell 
      biosensor based on the slime mould Physarum polycephalum (PP). The electrical 
      response of PP when exposed to multiple chemicals are measured and quantified in 
      terms of amplitude and frequency response. The PP biosensor is capable of detecting 
      the tested chemicals and individually identifying a large number in terms of a 
      specific shift in either oscillation frequency or amplitude. However, it does 
      exhibit a sensitivity to environmental changes such as light level and temperature 
      which may interfere with the detection of the target analyte but could also be used 
      for wider sensing applications. It is proposed that this novel biosensor is capable 
      of detecting many organic chemicals beyond those presented in this work and that the 
      biosensor may be used for environmental monitoring and toxicity evaluation.

TI  - Information propagation by spatio-temporal pattern change of Ca2+ concentration 
      throughout Physarum polycephalum with repulsive stimulation.
PG  - 111-5
AB  - The development of a spatio-temporal pattern of Ca2+ concentration (Ca2+ pattern) in 
      the plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum during repulsive response was studied using 
      fura-2. In the migrating cell, the gradient of the Ca2+ concentration (Ca2+ 
      gradient) immediately showed a decrease in local concentration in the area (S-site) 
      stimulated by 50 mM KCl. The concentration rose and then decreased in a site 
      neighboring the S-site. This transient increase of Ca2+ concentration, the duration 
      of which was approx. 10 minutes, was propagated to the site most distant from the 
      S-site. There, the Ca2+ concentration gradually rose and remained at a high level. 
      Twenty-five minutes after stimulation, a new Ca2+ gradient was established 
      throughout the plasmodium. The migratory direction of the cell as a whole then 
      changed. In this process, although the period of Ca2+ oscillation changed at the 
      S-site, this change was only local to the site. During the information processing of 
      the local repulsive stimulus, the transient Ca2+ increase propagated the local 
      information about the stimulus to the non-stimulation sites (NS-sites), leading to 
      the generation of a new pattern and the start of coordinated migration of the 
      plasmodium.

      behaviour.
LID - 10.1098/rspb.2015.2322 [doi]
LID - 20152322
AB  - Historically, research has focused on the mean and often neglected the variance. 
      However, variability in nature is observable at all scales: among cells within an 
      individual, among individuals within a population and among populations within a 
      species. A fundamental quest in biology now is to find the mechanisms that underlie 
      variability. Here, we investigated behavioural variability in a unique unicellular 
      organism, Physarum polycephalum. We combined experiments and models to show that 
      variability in cell signalling contributes to major differences in behaviour 
      underpinning some aspects of social interactions. First, following thousands of 
      cells under various contexts, we identified distinct behavioural phenotypes: 
      'slow-regular-social', 'fast-regular-social' and 'fast-irregular-asocial'. Second, 
      coupling chemical analysis and behavioural assays we found that calcium signalling 
      is responsible for these behavioural phenotypes. Finally, we show that differences 
      in signalling and behaviour led to alternative social strategies. Our results have 
      considerable implications for our understanding of the emergence of variability in 
      living organisms.

LID - 531032
AB  - Routing in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is an extremely challenging issue due to 
      the features of WSNs. Inspired by the large and single-celled amoeboid organism, 
      slime mold Physarum polycephalum, we establish a novel selecting next hop model 
      (SNH). Based on this model, we present a novel Physarum-based routing scheme (P-bRS) 
      for WSNs to balance routing efficiency and energy equilibrium. In P-bRS, a sensor 
      node can choose the proper next hop by using SNH which comprehensively considers the 
      distance, energy residue, and location of the next hop. The simulation results show 
      how P-bRS can achieve the effective trade-off between routing efficiency and energy 
      equilibrium compared to two famous algorithms.

PG  - 783-9
AB  - The dynamic state of post-translational acetylation of eukaryotic histones is 
      maintained by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). 
      HATs and HDACs have been shown to be components of various regulatory protein 
      complexes in the cell. Their enzymatic activities, intracellular localization and 
      substrate specificities are regulated in a complex, cell cycle related manner. In 
      the myxomycete Physarum polycephalum multiple HATs and HDACs can be distinguished in 
      biochemical terms and they exhibit dynamic activity patterns depending on the cell 
      cycle stage. Here we report on the cloning of the first P. polycephalum HDAC 
      (PpHDAC1) related to the S. cerevisiae Rpd3 protein. The expression pattern of 
      PpHDAC1 mRNA was analysed at different time points of the cell cycle and found to be 
      largely constant. Treatment of macroplasmodia with the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A 
      at several cell cycle stages resulted in a significant delay in entry into mitosis 
      of treated versus untreated plasmodia. No effect of TSA treatment could be observed 
      on PpHDAC1 expression itself.

TI  - Mapping of a replication origin within the promoter region of two unlinked, 
      abundantly transcribed actin genes of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 968-76
AB  - We analyzed the replication of two unlinked actin genes, ardB and ardC , which are 
      abundantly transcribed in the naturally synchronous plasmodium of the slime mold 
      Physarum polycephalum. Detection and size measurements of single-stranded nascent 
      replication intermediates (RIs) demonstrate that these two genes are concomitantly 
      replicated at the onset of the 3-h S phase and tightly linked to replication 
      origins. Appearance of RIs on neutral-neutral two-dimensional gels at specific time 
      points in early S phase and analysis of their structure confirmed these results and 
      further established that, in both cases, an efficient, site-specific, bidirectional 
      origin of replication is localized within the promoter region of the gene. We also 
      determined similar elongation rates for the divergent replication forks of the ardC 
      gene replicon. Finally, taking advantage of a restriction fragment length 
      polymorphism, we studied allelic replicons and demonstrate similar localizations and 
      a simultaneous firing of allelic replication origins. Computer search revealed a low 
      level of homology between the promoters of ardB and ardC and, most notably, the 
      absence of DNA sequences similar to the yeast autonomously replicating sequence 
      consensus sequence in these Physarum origin regions. Our results with the ardB and 
      ardC actin genes support the model of early replicating origins located within the 
      promoter regions of abundantly transcribed genes in P. polycephalum.

TI  - Solving the Towers of Hanoi - how an amoeboid organism efficiently constructs 
      transport networks.
PG  - 1546-51
LID - 10.1242/jeb.081158 [doi]
AB  - Many biological systems require extensive networks to transport resources and 
      information. Biological networks must trade-off network efficiency with the risk of 
      network failure. Yet, biological networks develop in the absence of centralised 
      control from the interactions of many components. Moreover, many biological systems 
      need to be able to adapt when conditions change and the network requires 
      modification. We used the slime mould Physarum polycephalum (Schwein) to study how 
      the organism adapts its network after disruption. To allow us to determine the 
      efficiency of the constructed networks, we used a well-known shortest-path problem: 
      the Towers of Hanoi maze. We first show that while P. polycephalum is capable of 
      building networks with minimal length paths through the maze, most solutions are 
      sub-optimal. We then disrupted the network by severing the main connecting path 
      while opening a new path in the maze. In response to dynamic changes to the 
      environment, P. polycephalum reconstructed more efficient solutions, with all 
      replicates building networks with minimal length paths through the maze after 
      network disruption. While P. polycephalum altered some of its existing network to 
      accommodate changes in the environment, it also reconstructed large sections of the 
      network from scratch. We compared the results obtained from P. polycephalum with 
      those obtained using another distributed biological system: ant colonies. We 
      hypothesise that network construction in ants hinges upon stronger positive feedback 
      than for slime mould, ensuring that ants converge more accurately upon the shortest 
      path but are more constrained by the history of their networks in dynamic 
      environments.

AB  - Spatial memory enhances an organism's navigational ability. Memory typically resides 
      within the brain, but what if an organism has no brain? We show that the brainless 
      slime mold Physarum polycephalum constructs a form of spatial memory by avoiding 
      areas it has previously explored. This mechanism allows the slime mold to solve the 
      U-shaped trap problem--a classic test of autonomous navigational ability commonly 
      used in robotics--requiring the slime mold to reach a chemoattractive goal behind a 
      U-shaped barrier. Drawn into the trap, the organism must rely on other methods than 
      gradient-following to escape and reach the goal. Our data show that spatial memory 
      enhances the organism's ability to navigate in complex environments. We provide a 
      unique demonstration of a spatial memory system in a nonneuronal organism, 
      supporting the theory that an externalized spatial memory may be the functional 
      precursor to the internal memory of higher organisms.

TI  - Large complexes of beta-poly(L-malate) with DNA polymerase alpha, histones, and 
      other proteins in nuclei of growing plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 14741-51
AB  - Of the various cell types in the life cycle of Physarum polycephalum, only the 
      growing plasmodium contains the unusual polyester beta-poly(L-malate). The nuclei 
      exhibit large complexes of this polymer with nuclear proteins, among them DNA 
      polymerase alpha, histones, and HMG-like proteins. The complexes are indicated by 
      the results of size exclusion chromatography and chemical cross-linking with 
      1-ethyl-3-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC). After 
      hydroxylaminolysis of the cross-linked polyester, the proteins are liberated and 
      visualized on Western blots. The complexes of 1200-1400 kDa molecular mass exceed by 
      far the size of free beta-poly(L-malate) and proteins. The observed variation in 
      mass appears to be mainly a function of the kind and stoichiometry of the protein 
      constituents and may explain the relatively high molecular mass in S phase and the 
      low molecular mass during G2 phase of the mitotic cycle. The complexes are 
      considerably stable at moderate ionic strength (100 mM KCl). Also, endogenous 
      beta-poly(L-malate) does not exchange with added beta-[14C]poly(L-malate) during the 
      lysis of the nuclei and the sample preparation. The complexes are dissociated at 
      elevated concentrations of KCl, in the presence of spermine hydrochloride, or by 
      treatment with DEAE/cellulose. Available evidence indicates that beta-poly(L-malate) 
      may be involved in the maintenance of the plasmodial state of P. polycephalum.

TI  - Early activated replication origins within the cell cycle-regulated histone H4 genes 
      in Physarum.
PG  - 2091-8
AB  - It was previously shown that the two members of the cell cycle-regulated histone H4 
      gene family, H4-1 and H4-2, are replicated at the onset of S phase in the naturally 
      synchronous plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum, suggesting that they are flanked by 
      replication origins. It was further shown that a DNA fragment upstream of the H4-1 
      gene is able to confer autonomous replication of a plasmid in the budding yeast. In 
      this paper, we re-investigated replication of the unlinked Physarum histone H4 genes 
      by mapping the replication origin of these two loci using alkaline agarose gel and 
      neutral/neutral 2-dimensional agarose gel electrophoreses. We showed that the two 
      replicons containing the H4 genes are simultaneously activated at the onset of S 
      phase and we mapped an efficient, bidirectional replication origin in the vicinity 
      of each gene. Our data demonstrated that the Physarum sequence that functions as an 
      ARS in yeast is not the site of replication initiation at the H4-1 locus. We also 
      observed a stalling of the rightward moving replication fork downstream of the H4-1 
      gene, in a region where transient topoisomerase II sites were previously mapped. Our 
      results further extend the concept of replication/transcription coupling in Physarum 
      to cell cycle-regulated genes.

AB  - In this study the experimental dependencies of the velocity of shuttle endoplasmic 
      motion in the isolated plasmodial strand of Physarum polycephalum obtained by laser 
      Doppler microscopy are presented. The spectral analysis of the time dependencies of 
      the endoplasm allows obtaining two distinct harmonic components. Influence of KCN 
      and SHAM--inhibitors of cellular respiration--leads to a complete cessation of 
      endoplasmic motion in the strand. After removal of the inhibitors the respiratory 
      system becomes normal, gradually restoring the activity of both harmonic oscillation 
      sources. Based on the spectral analysis the simulated time-dependent velocity of the 
      endoplasmic motion is rather good consistent with experimental data.

TI  - DNA topoisomerase II sites in the histone H4 gene during the highly synchronous cell 
      cycle of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 2042-49
AB  - The nearly perfect synchrony of nuclear division in a plasmodium of Physarum 
      polycephalum provides a powerful system to analyze topoisomerase II cleavage sites 
      in the course of the cell cycle. The histone H4 locus, whose schedule of replication 
      and transcription is precisely known, was chosen for this analysis. Drug-induced 
      topoisomerase II sites are clustered downstream of the histone H4 gene and appear 
      highly dependent on cell cycle stage. They were only detected in mitosis and at the 
      very beginning of S phase, precisely at the time of replication of the histone H4 
      region. The sites, which were absent in G2 phase, reappeared at the next mitosis. 
      Remarkably, DNase I hypersensitive sites occurred in nearly the same location, but 
      their schedule was totally different: they were absent in mitosis and present in G2. 
      This schedule follows H4 transcription, which peaks in mid-S phase and in the second 
      part of G2 phase and is off during mitosis. These results suggest that topoisomerase 
      II may not be involved in transcription, but plays a role in remodeling chromatin 
      structure, both during chromosome condensation in prophase/metaphase to allow their 
      decatenation and during chromosome decondensation after metaphase to allow 
      replication fork passage throughout the region.

TI  - Complex terminal structure of a linear mitochondrial plasmid from Physarum 
      polycephalum: three terminal inverted repeats and an ORF encoding DNA polymerase.
PG  - 252-7
AB  - The mitochondria of Physarum polycephalum have a linear plasmid (mF) which promotes 
      mitochondrial fusion. To determine the terminal structure of the mF plasmid, 
      restriction fragments derived from its ends were cloned and sequenced. The sequences 
      showed that the mF plasmid has three kinds of terminal inverted repeats (TIRs). The 
      most characteristic feature is a 144-bp repeating unit which exists between a 205-bp 
      TIR at the extreme ends of the plasmid and another 591-bp TIR. All of the clones 
      showed at least one of these 144-bp repeating units. The GC content of the 205-bp 
      TIR (49%) was higher than those of the other TIRs and of another sequenced region 
      (23%). This TIR can form three thermodynamically-stable hairpin structures based on 
      complex internal palindromic components. Moreover, in the right terminal region of 
      the mF plasmid, there is an open reading frame (ORF) which covers the entire 591-bp 
      TIR and most of one of the 144-bp repeating units. This ORF encodes a 547-amino-acid 
      polypeptide, ORF-547, and shows extensive homology with the polymerization domain of 
      the putative DNA polymerases of linear mitochondrial plasmids from other sources.

TI  - Editing of cytochrome b mRNA in physarum mitochondria.
PG  - 2725-31
AB  - The reading frame in the mRNA for the cytochrome b apoprotein in mitochondria of 
      Physarum polycephalum is created by the insertion of 43 nucleotides in the mRNA 
      relative to the mtDNA sequence encoding it (RNA editing). Most of these insertions 
      (31) are single cytidines; however, single uridines are inserted at six sites, and 
      the dinucleotides, CU and GC, are inserted at two sites and one site, respectively. 
      These insertions create a 392-codon reading frame in the mature mRNA. The amino acid 
      sequence inferred from this reading frame has similarity to cytochrome b apoproteins 
      encoded by other mtDNAs. The insertions are quite evenly distributed throughout the 
      length of the reading frame with an average spacing of 27 nucleotides. This mRNA has 
      the highest percentage (23%) of noncytidine insertions of any Physarum RNA 
      characterized to date. cDNAs corresponding to partially edited RNAs can be enriched 
      by selective amplification. Some cDNAs that lack the GC dinucleotide insertion are 
      fully edited at sites flanking the GC dinucleotide insertion site. Similarly some 
      cDNAs lack the CT dinucleotide insertion or have a CC or TT insertion flanked by a 
      fully edited sequence. These results imply that dinucleotide editing occurs by a 
      process separate from the global insertion of cytidines.

AB  - Recent experiments on ants and slime moulds have assessed the degree to which they 
      make rational decisions when presented with a number of alternative food sources or 
      shelter. Ants and slime moulds are just two examples of a wide range of species and 
      biological processes that use positive feedback mechanisms to reach decisions. Here 
      we use a generic, experimentally validated model of positive feedback between group 
      members to show that the probability of taking the best of options depends crucially 
      on the strength of feedback. We show how the probability of choosing the best option 
      can be maximized by applying an optimal feedback strength. Importantly, this optimal 
      value depends on the number of options, so that when we change the number of options 
      the preference of the group changes, producing apparent "irrationalities". We thus 
      reinterpret the idea that collectives show "rational" or "irrational" preferences as 
      being a necessary consequence of the use of positive feedback. We argue that 
      positive feedback is a heuristic which often produces fast and accurate group 
      decision-making, but is always susceptible to apparent irrationality when studied 
      under particular experimental conditions.

AB  - Physarum polycephalum is a large single amoeba cell, which in its plasmodial phase, 
      forages and connects nearby food sources with protoplasmic tubes. The organism 
      forages for food by growing these tubes towards detected foodstuff, this foraging 
      behaviour is governed by simple rules of photoavoidance and chemotaxis. The 
      electrical activity of the tubes oscillates, creating a peristaltic like action 
      within the tubes, forcing cytoplasm along the lumen; the frequency of this 
      oscillation controls the speed and direction of growth. External stimuli such as 
      light and food cause changes in the oscillation frequency. We demonstrate that using 
      these stimuli as logical inputs we can approximate logic gates using these tubes and 
      derive combinational logic circuits by cascading the gates, with software analysis 
      providing the output of each gate and determining the input of the following gate. 
      Basic gates OR, AND and NOT were correct 90%, 77.8% and 91.7% of the time 
      respectively. Derived logic circuits XOR, half adder and full adder were 70.8%, 65% 
      and 58.8% accurate respectively. Accuracy of the combinational logic decreases as 
      the number of gates is increased, however they are at least as accurate as previous 
      logic approximations using spatial growth of P. polycephalum and up to 30 times as 
      fast at computing the logical output. The results shown here demonstrate a 
      significant advancement in organism-based computing, providing a solid basis for 
      hybrid computers of the future.

TI  - Inhibition of cell proliferation by a unique lysophosphatidic acid, PHYLPA, isolated 
      from Physarum polycephalum: signaling events of antiproliferative action by PHYLPA.
PG  - 363-70
AB  - The unique Physarum lysophosphatidic acid, PHYLPA, having a cyclopropane in the 
      fatty acid moiety and a cyclic phosphate at C-2 and C-3 positions of the glycerol, 
      inhibited proliferation of human fibroblast cells, TIG-3 and TIG-7, which were 
      cultured in a chemically defined (serum-free) medium. The cells at S- and M-phases 
      proceeded to G2- and G1-phases, respectively, and most of cells were arrested at G1- 
      or G2-phase during PHYLPA treatment. The growth was recovered when PHYLPA was 
      removed from the medium. In the presence of serum, PHYLPA did not show obvious 
      inhibitory effects, indicating the existence of a factor(s) which neutralizes the 
      antiproliferative activity of PHYLPA. PHYLPA elicited an increase in 3',5'-cyclic 
      adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in a biphasic fashion in fibroblast cells. It also 
      elicited inositol phosphate accumulation, as well as a transient rise in cytoplasmic 
      free Ca2+ ion.

TI  - Adaptation and optimization of biological transport networks.
PG  - 138701
AB  - It has been hypothesized that topological structures of biological transport 
      networks are consequences of energy optimization. Motivated by experimental 
      observation, we propose that adaptation dynamics may underlie this optimization. In 
      contrast to the global nature of optimization, our adaptation dynamics responds only 
      to local information and can naturally incorporate fluctuations in flow 
      distributions. The adaptation dynamics minimizes the global energy consumption to 
      produce optimal networks, which may possess hierarchical loop structures in the 
      presence of strong fluctuations in flow distribution. We further show that there may 
      exist a new phase transition as there is a critical open probability of sinks, above 
      which there are only trees for network structures whereas below which loops begin to 
      emerge.

PG  - 1109-15
LID - 10.1016/j.bios.2009.09.036 [doi]
AB  - Electrical impedance tomography is an imaging technology that spatially 
      characterizes the electrical properties of an object. We present a miniaturized 
      electrical impedance tomography system that can image the electrical conductivity 
      distribution within a two-dimensional cell culture. A chip containing a circular 
      16-electrode array was fabricated using printed circuit board developing technology 
      and used to inject current and to measure spatial voltage across the object. The 
      signal stimulation and voltage data acquisition were performed using an impedance 
      analyzer, operating in four-electrode mode. An open source software, EIDORS was used 
      for image reconstruction. Finite element modelling was used to simulate the image 
      reconstruction process by imaging two ellipsoidal phantoms in the circular 
      16-electrode array. The effect of the regularization parameter in the reconstruction 
      algorithm and the influence from noise on the fidelity of the images has been 
      numerically analyzed. Experimentally, we show reconstructed images of a 
      multi-nuclear single cellular organism, Physarum Polycephalum, demonstrating the 
      first step towards impedance imaging of single cells in culture. Our system provides 
      a non-invasive lab-on-a-chip technology for spatially mapping the electrical 
      properties of single cells, which would be significant and useful for diagnostic and 
      clinical applications.

AB  - The electric potential difference (1 to 15 mv.) between two loci of the slime mold 
      connected with a strand of protoplasm changes rhythmically with the same period (60 
      to 180 seconds) as that of back and forth protoplasmic streaming along the strand. 
      When atmospheric pressure at a part of the plasmodium is increased (about 10 cm. 
      H(2)O), the electric potential at this part becomes positive (0 to 20 mv.) to 
      another part with a time constant of 2 to 15 minutes. If the atmospheric pressure at 
      a part of the plasmodium is changed (about 10 cm. H(2)O) periodically, the electric 
      potential rhythm also changes with the same period as that of the applied pressure 
      change, and the amplitude of the former grows to a new level (i.e., forced 
      oscillation). The electric potential rhythm, in this case, is generally delayed 
      about 90 degrees in phase angle from the external pressure change. The period of the 
      electric potential rhythm which coincided with that of the pressure change is 
      maintained for a while after stopping the application of the pressure change, if the 
      period is not much different from the native flow rhythm. Such a pressure effect is 
      brought about by the forced transport of protoplasm and is reversible as a rule. In 
      the statistical analysis made by Kishimoto (1958) and in the rheological treatment 
      made in the report, the rhythmic deformation of the contractile protein networks is 
      supposed to be the cause of the protoplasmic flow along the strand and of the 
      electric potential rhythm. The role of such submicroscopic networks in the 
      protoplasm in various kinds of protoplasmic movement is emphasized.

TI  - Smart network solutions in an amoeboid organism.
PG  - 1-5
AB  - We present evidence that the giant amoeboid organism, the true slime mold, 
      constructs a network appropriate for maximizing nutrient uptake. The body of the 
      plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum contains a network of tubular elements by means 
      of which nutrients and chemical signals circulate through the organism. When food 
      pellets were presented at different points on the plasmodium it accumulated at each 
      pellet with a few tubes connecting the plasmodial concentrations. The geometry of 
      the network depended on the positions of the food sources. Statistical analysis 
      showed that the network geometry met the multiple requirements of a smart network: 
      short total length of tubes, close connections among all the branches (a small 
      number of transit food-sites between any two food-sites) and tolerance of accidental 
      disconnection of the tubes. These findings indicate that the plasmodium can achieve 
      a better solution to the problem of network configuration than is provided by the 
      shortest connection of Steiner's minimum tree.

TI  - SURVEY AND SUMMARY: exon-intron organization of genes in the slime mold Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 3411-6
AB  - The slime mold Physarum polycephalum is a morphologically simple organism with a 
      large and complex genome. The exon-intron organization of its genes exhibits 
      features typical for protists and fungi as well as those characteristic for the 
      evolutionarily more advanced species. This indicates that both the taxonomic 
      position as well as the size of the genome shape the exon-intron organization of an 
      organism. The average gene has 3.7 introns which are on average 138 bp, with a 
      rather narrow size distribution. Introns are enriched in AT base pairs by 13% 
      relative to exons. The consensus sequences at exon-intron boundaries resemble those 
      found for other species, with minor differences between short and long introns. A 
      unique feature of P.polycephalum introns is the strong preference for pyrimidines in 
      the coding strand throughout their length, without a particular enrichment at the 
      3'-ends.

TI  - An atypical topoisomerase II sequence from the slime mold Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 79-87
AB  - We have determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the cDNA encoding DNA 
      topoisomerase II from Physarum polycephalum. Using degenerate primers, based on the 
      conserved amino acid sequences of other eukaryotic enzymes, a 250-bp fragment was 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified. This fragment was used as a probe to 
      screen a Physarum cDNA library. A partial cDNA clone was isolated that was truncated 
      at the 3' end. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)-PCR was employed to isolate 
      the remaining portion of the gene. The complete sequence of 4613 bp contains an open 
      reading frame of 4494 bp that codes for 1498 amino acid residues with a theoretical 
      molecular weight of 167 kDa. The predicted amino acid sequence shares similarity 
      with those of other eukaryotes and shows the highest degree of identity with the 
      enzyme of Dictyostelium discoideum. However, the enzyme of P. polycephalum contains 
      an atypical amino-terminal domain very rich in serine and proline, whose function is 
      unknown. Remarkably, both a mitochondrial targeting sequence and a nuclear 
      localization signal were predicted respectively in the amino and carboxy-terminus of 
      the protein, as in the case of human topoisomerase III alpha. At the Physarum 
      genomic level, the topoisomerase II gene encompasses a region of about 16 kbp 
      suggesting a large proportion of intronic sequences, an unusual situation for a gene 
      of a lower eukaryote, often free of introns. Finally, expression of topoisomerase II 
      mRNA does not appear significantly dependent on the plasmodium cycle stage, possibly 
      due to the lack of G1 phase or (and) to a mitochondrial localization of the enzyme.

LID - e0139617
AB  - Collision-based computing (CBC) is a form of unconventional computing in which 
      travelling localisations represent data and conditional routing of signals 
      determines the output state; collisions between localisations represent logical 
      operations. We investigated patterns of Ca2+-containing vesicle distribution within 
      a live organism, slime mould Physarum polycephalum, with confocal microscopy and 
      observed them colliding regularly. Vesicles travel down cytoskeletal 'circuitry' and 
      their collisions may result in reflection, fusion or annihilation. We demonstrate 
      through experimental observations that naturally-occurring vesicle dynamics may be 
      characterised as a computationally-universal set of Boolean logical operations and 
      present a 'vesicle modification' of the archetypal CBC 'billiard ball model' of 
      computation. We proceed to discuss the viability of intracellular vesicles as an 
      unconventional computing substrate in which we delineate practical considerations 
      for reliable vesicle 'programming' in both in vivo and in vitro vesicle computing 
      architectures and present optimised designs for both single logical gates and 
      combinatorial logic circuits based on cytoskeletal network conformations. The 
      results presented here demonstrate the first characterisation of intracelluar 
      phenomena as collision-based computing and hence the viability of biological 
      substrates for computing.

LID - 10.1088/1748-3190/ab3b12 [doi]
AB  - Inspired by shape-shifting features of slime mould growth, we implement a 
      computational algorithm to study the nutrient-induced pattern formation and 
      transition of slime mould. We then translate the learned principles into the design 
      and characterization of cellular materials, with particular focus on the issue of 
      spatial heterogeneity due to the nature of the non-uniform, asymmetric pattern. 
      Guided by clustering analysis, compression tests on 3D-printed samples, and 
      numerical simulations by finite element models, we were able to categorize patterns 
      with certain geometric features (such as layout and symmetry) and found similar 
      mechanical response features, indicating high tailorability of non-uniform 
      architected materials. This study paves the road for the advanced computer-aided 
      design of architected materials and its potential in the development of innovative 
      engineering mechanical devices and structural systems.

TI  - [Involvement of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate binding proteins in the 
      generation of contractile oscillations in the Physarum polycephalum plasmodium].
PG  - 933-40
AB  - Using the Physarum polycephalum, plasmodium, a giant amoeboid cell with the strongly 
      pronounced auto-oscillatory mode of motility, which exhibits regularities of motile 
      behavior common with those of tissue cells and has the same signal systems, the 
      possibility of the participation of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate in the 
      regulation of the contractile activity has been studied. The effect of neomycin as a 
      substrate inhibitor of phospholipase C, which binds with high affinity to 
      phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate in the membrane, on force oscillations 
      generated by plasmodial strands under isometric conditions and after the addition of 
      the protein kinase C inhibitors staurosporine, UCN-01, and Ro-318220, separatelyand 
      in combination with the calmodulin inhibitor calmidazolium has been examined. It has 
      been shown that neomycin at pH 7.0 and concentrations of 0.1-5.0 mM stops 
      contractile oscillations for 10-30 min but then they begin to gradually restore; the 
      oscillation period at the initial stage of the restoration is.shorter than it was 
      earlier and then increases due to the elongation of the contraction phase. Analysis 
      of data obtained is in favor of the assumption that the plasmodial membrane contains 
      MARCKS-like proteins and protein kinase C-controlled pools of 
      phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate, which can participate in the generation of 
      auto-oscillations observed in the plasmodium.

AB  - Despite the presence of linker histone in all eukaryotes, the primary function(s) of 
      this histone have been difficult to clarify. Knock-out experiments indicate that H1s 
      play a role in regulation of only a small subset of genes but are an essential 
      component in mouse development. Here, we show that linker histone (H1) is involved 
      in the global regulation of DNA replication in Physarum polycephalum. We find that 
      genomic DNA of H1 knock-down cells is more rapidly replicated, an effect due at 
      least in part to disruption of the native timing of replication fork firing. 
      Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that H1 is transiently lost from 
      replicating chromatin via a process facilitated by phosphorylation. Our results 
      suggest that linker histones generate a chromatin environment refractory to 
      replication and that their transient removal via protein phosphorylation during S 
      phase is a critical step in the epigenetic regulation of replication timing.

TI  - Obtaining multiple separate food sources: behavioural intelligence in the Physarum 
      plasmodium.
PG  - 2305-10
AB  - To evaluate performance in a complex survival task, we studied the morphology of the 
      Physarum plasmodium transportation network when presented with multiple separate 
      food sources. The plasmodium comprises a network of tubular elements through which 
      chemical nutrient, intracellular signals and the viscous body are transported and 
      circulated. When three separate food sources were presented, located at the vertices 
      of a triangle, the tubular network connected them via a short pathway, which was 
      often analogous to the mathematically shortest route known as Steiner's minimum tree 
      (SMT). The other common network shape had high fault tolerance against accidental 
      disconnection of the tubes and was known as cycle (CYC). Pattern selection appeared 
      to be a bistable system involving SMT and CYC. When more than three food sources 
      were presented, the network pattern tended to be a patchwork of SMT and CYC. We 
      therefore concluded that the plasmodium tube network is a well designed and 
      intelligent system.

TI  - Cotranscriptional editing of Physarum mitochondrial RNA requires local features of 
      the native template.
PG  - 1174-85
AB  - RNAs in the mitochondrion of Physarum polycephalum are edited by the precise 
      cotranscriptional addition of non-encoded nucleotides. Here we describe experiments 
      to address the basis of editing specificity using a series of chimeric templates 
      generated by either rearranging the DNA present in editing-competent mitochondrial 
      transcription elongation complexes (mtTECs) or linking it to exogenous DNA. Notably, 
      run-on transcripts synthesized from rearranged mtTECs are edited at the natural 
      sites, even when different genes are ligated together, yet exogenous, deproteinized 
      DNA does not support editing. Furthermore, the accuracy of nucleotide insertion in 
      chimeric RNAs argues that any cis-acting determinants of cytidine insertion are 
      limited to small regions surrounding editing sites. Taken together, these 
      observations strongly suggest that template-associated factors affect read-out of 
      the mitochondrial genome.

      in vivo.

LID - 10.1091/mbc.E10-07-0633 [doi]
AB  - While specific posttranslational modification patterns within the H3 and H4 tail 
      domains are associated with the S-phase, their actual functions in 
      replication-dependent chromatin assembly have not yet been defined. Here we used 
      incorporation of trace amounts of recombinant proteins into naturally synchronous 
      macroplasmodia of Physarum polycephalum to examine the function of H3 and H4 tail 
      domains in replication-coupled chromatin assembly. We found that the H3/H4 complex 
      lacking the H4 tail domain was not efficiently recovered in nuclei, whereas 
      depletion of the H3 tail domain did not impede nuclear import but chromatin assembly 
      failed. Furthermore, our results revealed that the proper pattern of acetylation on 
      the H4 tail domain is required for nuclear import and chromatin assembly. This is 
      most likely due to binding of Hat1, as coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed Hat1 
      associated with predeposition histones in the cytoplasm and with replicating 
      chromatin. These results suggest that the type B histone acetyltransferase assists 
      in shuttling the H3/H4 complex from cytoplasm to the replication forks.

TI  - Rearrangements in the Physarum polycephalum mitochondrial genome associated with a 
      transition from linear mF-mtDNA recombinants to circular molecules.
PG  - 100-10
AB  - Although mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is transmitted to progeny from one parent only in 
      Physarum polycephalum, the mtDNAs of progeny of mF+ plasmodia vary in structure. To 
      clarify the mechanisms associated with the mitochondrial plasmid mF that generate 
      mtDNA polymorphisms, 91 progeny of four strains (KM88 x JE8, KM88 x TU111, KM88 x 
      NG111, Je90) were investigated using RFLP analysis, PCR, and pulse-field gel 
      electrophoresis (PFGE). Nine mtDNA rearrangement types were found, with 
      rearrangements occurring exclusively in the mF regions. PFGE revealed that, in the 
      groups containing rearranged mtDNA, the linear mF-mtDNA recombinants had 
      recircularized. Sequencing the rearranged region of one of the progeny suggested 
      that the mF plasmid and the mtDNA recombine primarily at the ID sequences, 
      linearizing the circular mtDNA. Recombination between the terminal region of the mF 
      plasmid and a region about 1 kbp upstream of the mitochondrial/plasmid ID sequence 
      results in a rearranged circular mtDNA, with variations caused by differences in the 
      secondary recombination region.

TI  - Characterization of npf mutants identifying developmental genes in Physarum.
PG  - 799-816
AB  - In Physarum polycephalum, uninucleate haploid amoebae develop into macroscopic 
      multinucleate plasmodia. Wild-type, sexual development is triggered when two amoebae 
      carrying different alleles of matA fuse to form a zygote which develops into a 
      diploid plasmodium. Mutations in the matA genetic region give rise to apogamic 
      strains in which a single haploid amoeba can develop into a haploid plasmodium. An 
      essential stage in both sexual and apogamic plasmodium formation is an extended cell 
      cycle in uninucleate cells, which ends with the formation of a binucleate cell by 
      mitosis without cytokinesis. Using a 'brute force' screening method, we have 
      isolated mutants blocked in apogamic plasmodium development. Genetic analysis showed 
      that the mutations we have identified were unlinked to matA, unlike mutations 
      previously identified following an enrichment step. Most of the loci revealed by our 
      screen were represented by only one allele, indicating that further screening should 
      lead to the identification of additional genes required for plasmodium development. 
      Phenotypic analysis showed that different mutants were blocked at different stages 
      of plasmodium formation. Some of the mutations blocking apogamic development at an 
      early stage, close to the start of the long cell cycle, failed to block sexual 
      development in zygotes homozygous for the mutation. Since the two modes of 
      plasmodium formation differ only in the initiation of development, these mutations 
      presumably interfere with the initiation process. In the remaining mutants, in which 
      both sexual and apogamic development were blocked, development first became abnormal 
      towards the end of the long cell cycle. This suggested that the wild-type gene 
      products were required by this time and was consistent with previous evidence that 
      many changes in cellular organization and gene expression occur during the long cell 
      cycle. Each of these mutants showed a different terminal phenotype and some aspects 
      of plasmodium development occurred normally although others were blocked, suggesting 
      that development involves multiple pathways rather than a dependent sequence of 
      events. Phenotypic analysis of double mutants supported this conclusion and also 
      revealed epistatic interactions, presumably due to blocks in the same pathway. In 
      several of the mutants, terminally differentiated cells died by an apoptosis-like 
      mechanism; since this was never observed in vegetative cells, it was presumably 
      triggered by the failure of development. Phenotypic analyses of additional mutants 
      will extend our understanding of the pathways involved in plasmodium development.

AB  - RNAs made in the mitochondrion of Physarum polycephalum are edited relative to their 
      template by the precise addition of nonencoded nucleotides, while they are being 
      synthesized. This insertional editing has been reproduced in vitro during run-on 
      extension of RNAs initiated in vivo, within partially purified mitochondrial 
      transcription elongation complexes (mtTECs), but it does not occur when the 
      mitochondrial polymerase initiates transcription on exogenous cloned DNA. This 
      chapter describes in vitro transcription systems in which mtTEC RNAs are elongated 
      on repositioned parts of the genome or exogenous DNA, in order to investigate how 
      the nontemplated insertions are directed. Restriction enzyme digestion and DNA 
      ligation are used to generate the chimeric templates, and the RNA products are 
      analyzed directly by nuclease dissection (S1 protection followed by RNase T1 
      digestion) or by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) followed 
      by restriction enzyme analysis or cloning and sequencing.

TI  - [A comparative structure-function analysis and molecular mechanism of action of 
      endonucleases from Serratia marcescens and Physarum polycephalum].
PG  - 23-31
AB  - Structural and functional characteristics were compared for wild-type nuclease from 
      Serratia marcescens, which belongs to the family of DNA/RNA nonspecific 
      endonucleases, its mutational forms, and the nuclease I-PpoI from Physarum 
      polycephalum, which is a representative of the Cys-His box-containing subgroup of 
      the superfamily of extremely specific intron-encoded homing DNases. Despite the lack 
      of sequence homology and the overall different topology of the Serratia marcescens 
      and I-PpoI nucleases, their active sites have a remarkable structural similarity. 
      Both of them have a unique magnesium atom in the active site, which is a part of the 
      coordinatively bonded water-magnesium complex involved in their catalytic acts. In 
      the enzyme-substrate complexes, the Mg2+ ion is chelated by an Asp residue, 
      coordinates two oxygen atoms of DNA, and stabilizes the transition state of the 
      phosphate anion and 3'-OH group of the leaving nucleotide. A new mechanism of the 
      phosphodiester bond cleavage, which is common for the Serratia marcescens and I-PpoI 
      nucleases and differs from the known functioning mechanism of the restriction and 
      homing endonucleases, was proposed. It presumes a His residue as a general base for 
      the activation of a non-cluster water molecule at the nucleophilic in line 
      displacement of the 3'-leaving group. A strained metalloenzyme-substrate complex is 
      formed during hydrolysis and relaxes to the initial state after the reaction. The 
      English version of the paper.

TI  - Mathematical model for rhythmic protoplasmic movement in the true slime mold.
PG  - 273-86
AB  - The plasmodium of the true slime mold Physarum polycephalum is a large amoeboid 
      organism that displays "smart" behavior such as chemotaxis and the ability to solve 
      mazes and geometrical puzzles. These amoeboid behaviors are based on the dynamics of 
      the viscoelastic protoplasm and its biochemical rhythms. By incorporating both these 
      aspects, we constructed a mathematical model for the dynamics of the organism as a 
      first step towards understanding the relation between protoplasmic movement and its 
      unusual abilities. We tested the validity of the model by comparing it with 
      physiological observation. Our model reproduces fundamental characteristics of the 
      spatio-temporal pattern of the rhythmic movement: (1) the antiphase oscillation 
      between frontal tip and rear when the front is freely extending; (2) the 
      asynchronous oscillation pattern when the front is not freely extending; and (3) the 
      formation of protoplasmic mounds over a longer time scale. Both our model and 
      physiological observation suggest that cell stiffness plays a primary role in 
      plasmodial behaviors, in contrast to the conventional theory of coupled oscillator 
      systems.

TI  - [Expression silence of Physarum polycephalum serine/arginine protein kinase by small 
      interfering RNA].
PG  - 129-38
AB  - Serine/arginine protein kinases are specific kinase family for phosphorylating SR 
      protein regulating alternative splicing of SR protein and its distribution, 
      localization in the nucleus. However, it is unclear how Physarum Polycephalum 
      Serine/Arginine Protein Kinase(PSRPK) functions in the cells. In order to study its 
      function, Oligonucleotides for transcribing siRNAs were designed and inserted into 
      pSIREN-RetroQ vector to construct pSIREN-PSRPK-1, pSIREN-PSRPK-2, pSIREN-PSRPK-3, 
      pSIREN-PSRPK-4, pSIREN-PSRPK-5 for expressing siRNAs targeting at PSRPK, as well as 
      the negative control pSIREN-PSRPK-Neg. The PSRPK cDNA amplified by PCR was inserted 
      into the pDsRed-N1 vector to construct a pPSRPK-DsRed plasmid. After the 
      pPSRPK-DsRed was co-transfected into HEK293 cell with recombinant siRNA expression 
      plasmids respectively, the PSRPK-DsRed fusion fluorescent protein was observed under 
      fluorescent microscope after 72 hours co-transfection. The results indicated that 
      pSIREN-PSRPK-2 and pSIREN-PSRPK-5 were able to inhibit the expression of PSRPK-DsRed 
      fusion fluorescent protein efficiently. RT-PCR and Northern dot blot analysis 
      further demonstrated that pSIREN-PSRPK-2 and pSIREN-PSRPK-5 can effectively inhibit 
      PSRPK expression, which accorded with the results under the fluorescent microscope.

TI  - Path finding by tube morphogenesis in an amoeboid organism.
PG  - 47-52
AB  - We have studied how the plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum, a large amoeboid cell, 
      is able to track the shortest path between two selected points in a labyrinth. When 
      nutrients are supplied at these points to a sheet-like plasmodium extended fully in 
      a maze, the organism forms a single tube which connects the two sites via the 
      shortest route. During the path finding, plasmodial parts in dead ends of the maze 
      shrink and finally the tube with the minimum-length is selected from the existing 
      possibilities. A simple cellular mechanism based on interacting cellular rhythms may 
      describe the experimental observations.

TI  - [The role of phosphoinositide-3-kinase in controlling the shape and directional 
      movement in Physarum polycephalum plasmodium].
PG  - 986-92
AB  - The influence of wortmannin and LY294002, specific inhibitors of 
      phosphoinosite-3-kinase, on the shape, motile behavior, and chemotaxis toward 
      glucose has been investigated in Physarum polycephalum plasmodium, a multinuclear 
      amoeboid cell with the autooscillatory mode of motion. Both inhibitors were shown to 
      cause a reduction of the plasmodium frontal edge and a decrease in the efficiency of 
      mass transfer during migration. They also suppress chemotaxis toward glucose and 
      eliminate characteristic changes in autooscillatory behavior normally observed in 
      response to the treatment of the whole plasmodium with glucose. The manifestation of 
      these effects depends on the inhibitor concentration, the duration of treatment, and 
      the size of plasmodium. The involvement of phosphoinosite-3-kinase in creating the 
      frontal edge and in controlling the chemotaxis of Physarum plasmodium suggests that 
      the interrelation of polar shape and directional movement of amoeboid cells with the 
      distribution of phosphoinositides in the plasma membrane has the universal nature.

AB  - The heterogeneity of cell populations and the influence of stochastic noise might be 
      important issues for the molecular analysis of cellular reprogramming at the system 
      level. Here, we show that in Physarum polycephalum, the expression patterns of 
      marker genes correlate with the fate decision of individual multinucleate plasmodial 
      cells that had been exposed to a differentiation-inducing photostimulus. For several 
      hours after stimulation, the expression kinetics of PI-3-kinase, piwi, and pumilio 
      orthologs and other marker genes were qualitatively similar in all stimulated cells 
      but quantitatively different in those cells that subsequently maintained their 
      proliferative potential and failed to differentiate accordingly. The results suggest 
      that the population of nuclei in an individual plasmodium behaves synchronously in 
      terms of gene regulation to an extent that the plasmodium provides a source for 
      macroscopic amounts of homogeneous single-cell material for analysing the dynamic 
      processes of cellular reprogramming. Based on the experimental findings, we predict 
      that circuits with switch-like behaviour that control the cell fate decision of a 
      multinucleate plasmodium operate through continuous changes in the concentration of 
      cellular regulators because the nuclear population suspended in a large cytoplasmic 
      volume damps stochastic noise.

AB  - The cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase secreted by Physarum polycephalum plasmodium 
      into extracellular medium has been partially purified by DEAE cellulose 
      chromatography, ultrafiltration, and HPLC. The results obtained by gel filtration, 
      HPLC, electrophoresis, and isoelectric focusing suggest that, the native enzyme in 
      solution is a monomer with a molecular mass of about 90 kDa and pI in the range 3.6 
      - 4.0. The Km values were estimated to be about 0.9 mM and 7.7 mM, respectively, and 
      Vm for both substrates were similar (up to several thousand micromoles of cAMP 
      hydrolyzed/hour per mg of enzyme). The partially purified enzyme was shown to be 
      extremely stable. It did not lose the activity after heat treatment at 100 degrees C 
      during 30 min. The enzyme was active in the presence of 1% SDS, but it was fully 
      inactivated under the same conditions in the presence of beta-mercaptoethanol. The 
      properties of the phosphodiesterase from Physarum polycephalum are discussed.

TI  - Discovery of new genes and deletion editing in Physarum mitochondria enabled by a 
      novel algorithm for finding edited mRNAs.
PG  - 5063-72
AB  - Gene finding is complicated in organisms that exhibit insertional RNA editing. Here, 
      we demonstrate how our new algorithm Predictor of Insertional Editing (PIE) can be 
      used to locate genes whose mRNAs are subjected to multiple frameshifting events, and 
      extend the algorithm to include probabilistic predictions for sites of nucleotide 
      insertion; this feature is particularly useful when designing primers for sequencing 
      edited RNAs. Applying this algorithm, we successfully identified the nad2, nad4L, 
      nad6 and atp8 genes within the mitochondrial genome of Physarum polycephalum, which 
      had gone undetected by existing programs. Characterization of their mRNA products 
      led to the unanticipated discovery of nucleotide deletion editing in Physarum. The 
      deletion event, which results in the removal of three adjacent A residues, was 
      confirmed by primer extension sequencing of total RNA. This finding is remarkable in 
      that it comprises the first known instance of nucleotide deletion in this organelle, 
      to be contrasted with nearly 500 sites of single and dinucleotide addition in 
      characterized mitochondrial RNAs. Statistical analysis of this larger pool of 
      editing sites indicates that there are significant biases in the 2 nt immediately 
      upstream of editing sites, including a reduced incidence of nucleotide repeats, in 
      addition to the previously identified purine-U bias.

TI  - rDNA-directed integration by an HIV-1 integrase--I-PpoI fusion protein.
PG  - e61
LID - 10.1093/nar/gks1438 [doi]
AB  - Integrating viral vectors are efficient gene transfer tools, but their integration 
      patterns have been associated with genotoxicity and oncogenicity. The recent 
      development of highly specific designer nucleases has enabled target DNA 
      modification and site-specific gene insertion at desired genomic loci. However, a 
      lack of consensus exists regarding a perfect genomic safe harbour (GSH) that would 
      allow transgenes to be stably and reliably expressed without adversely affecting 
      endogenous gene structure and function. Ribosomal DNA (rDNA) has many advantages as 
      a GSH, but efficient means to target integration to this locus are currently 
      lacking. We tested whether lentivirus vector integration can be directed to rDNA by 
      using fusion proteins consisting of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 (HIV-1) 
      integrase (IN) and the homing endonuclease I-PpoI, which has natural cleavage sites 
      in the rDNA. A point mutation (N119A) was introduced into I-PpoI to abolish unwanted 
      DNA cleavage by the endonuclease. The vector-incorporated IN-I-PpoIN119A fusion 
      protein targeted integration into rDNA significantly more than unmodified lentivirus 
      vectors, with an efficiency of 2.7%. Our findings show that IN-fusion proteins can 
      be used to modify the integration pattern of lentivirus vectors, and to package 
      site-specific DNA-recognizing proteins into vectors to obtain safer transgene 
      integration.

TI  - Abundant 5S rRNA-like transcripts encoded by the mitochondrial genome in amoebozoa.
PG  - 762-73
LID - 10.1128/EC.00013-10 [doi]
AB  - 5S rRNAs are ubiquitous components of prokaryotic, chloroplast, and eukaryotic 
      cytosolic ribosomes but are apparently absent from mitochondrial ribosomes 
      (mitoribosomes) of many eukaryotic groups including animals and fungi. Nevertheless, 
      a clearly identifiable, mitochondrion-encoded 5S rRNA is present in Acanthamoeba 
      castellanii, a member of Amoebozoa. During a search for additional mitochondrial 5S 
      rRNAs, we detected small abundant RNAs in other members of Amoebozoa, namely, in the 
      lobose amoeba Hartmannella vermiformis and in the myxomycete slime mold Physarum 
      polycephalum. These RNAs are encoded by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), cosediment with 
      mitoribosomes in glycerol gradients, and can be folded into a secondary structure 
      similar to that of bona fide 5S rRNAs. Further, in the mtDNA of another slime mold, 
      Didymium nigripes, we identified a region that in sequence, potential secondary 
      structure, and genomic location is similar to the corresponding region encoding the 
      Physarum small RNA. A mtDNA-encoded small RNA previously identified in Dictyostelium 
      discoideum is here shown to share several characteristics with known 5S rRNAs. 
      Again, we detected genes encoding potential homologs of this RNA in the mtDNA of 
      three other species of the genus Dictyostelium as well as in a related genus, 
      Polysphondylium. Taken together, our results indicate a widespread occurrence of 
      small, abundant, mtDNA-encoded RNAs with 5S rRNA-like structures that are associated 
      with the mitoribosome in various amoebozoan taxa. Our working hypothesis is that 
      these novel small abundant RNAs represent radically divergent mitochondrial 5S rRNA 
      homologs. We posit that currently unrecognized 5S-like RNAs may exist in other 
      mitochondrial systems in which a conventional 5S rRNA cannot be identified.

TI  - A mathematical model for adaptive transport network in path finding by true slime 
      mold.
PG  - 553-64
AB  - We describe here a mathematical model of the adaptive dynamics of a transport 
      network of the true slime mold Physarum polycephalum, an amoeboid organism that 
      exhibits path-finding behavior in a maze. This organism possesses a network of 
      tubular elements, by means of which nutrients and signals circulate through the 
      plasmodium. When the organism is put in a maze, the network changes its shape to 
      connect two exits by the shortest path. This process of path-finding is attributed 
      to an underlying physiological mechanism: a tube thickens as the flux through it 
      increases. The experimental evidence for this is, however, only qualitative. We 
      constructed a mathematical model of the general form of the tube dynamics. Our model 
      contains a key parameter corresponding to the extent of the feedback regulation 
      between the thickness of a tube and the flux through it. We demonstrate the 
      dependence of the behavior of the model on this parameter.

TI  - Evolution of four types of RNA editing in myxomycetes.
PG  - 1339-46
AB  - The myxomycete Physarum polycephalum requires extensive RNA editing to create 
      functional mitochondrial transcripts. The cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (col) 
      transcript exhibits a combination of editing forms not found together in any other 
      eukaryotic RNA: 66 insertions of ribonucleotides (59 Cs, a single U, and three mixed 
      dinucleotides) as well as base conversion of four Cs to Us (Gott et al., J Biol 
      Chem, 1993, 268:25483-25486). Through a phylogenetic survey of col DNA genes and RNA 
      transcripts in representative myxomycetes, we have decoupled the four types of 
      editing in this lineage. Some myxomycetes share insertional editing with P. 
      polycephalum, yet lack C--> U conversion, consistent with previous reports of 
      separation of insertional and base conversion editing in P. polycephalum extracts 
      (Visomirski-Robic & Gott, RNA, 1995, 3:821-837). Most remarkably, we detect unique 
      evolutionary histories of the three different types of insertional editing, though 
      these have been indistinguishable in vitro. For example, Clastoderma debaryanum 
      exhibits insertions of Us, but not Cs or dinucleotides.

TI  - [Homology of histones H2B from calf thymus and P4B from slime mold Physarum 
      polycephalum].
PG  - 1056-61
AB  - A comparative study of the amino acid composition of histone fractions P4b from 
      slime mold Physarum polycephalum and H2B from calf thymus was carried out using 
      peptide mapping. It was shown that 75% of peptides are common for both proteins. The 
      slime mold histones contain two fractions (P4B and P3), which are homologous to the 
      H2B histone fraction of calf thymus. The data of amino acid analysis, peptide 
      mapping and some physico-chemical properties of the histones revealed the following 
      correlation of the two types of histone fractions: P1--H1, P4a--H3, P4b and P3--H2B, 
      P5-H2A, P6--H4.

TI  - Inhibitory effects of extracellular self-DNA: a general biological process?
PG  - 127-132
LID - 10.1111/nph.13306 [doi]
AB  - Self-inhibition of growth has been observed in different organisms, but an 
      underlying common mechanism has not been proposed so far. Recently, extracellular 
      DNA (exDNA) has been reported as species-specific growth inhibitor in plants and 
      proposed as an explanation of negative plant-soil feedback. In this work the effect 
      of exDNA was tested on different species to assess the occurrence of such inhibition 
      in organisms other than plants. Bioassays were performed on six species of different 
      taxonomic groups, including bacteria, fungi, algae, plants, protozoa and insects. 
      Treatments consisted in the addition to the growth substrate of conspecific and 
      heterologous DNA at different concentration levels. Results showed that treatments 
      with conspecific DNA always produced a concentration dependent growth inhibition, 
      which instead was not observed in the case of heterologous DNA. Reported evidence 
      suggests the generality of the observed phenomenon which opens new perspectives in 
      the context of self-inhibition processes. Moreover, the existence of a general 
      species-specific biological effect of exDNA raises interesting questions on its 
      possible involvement in self-recognition mechanisms. Further investigation at 
      molecular level will be required to unravel the specific functioning of the observed 
      inhibitory effects.

TI  - Replication-independent core histone dynamics at transcriptionally active loci in 
      vivo.
PG  - 677-82
AB  - We used a novel labeling technique in the naturally synchronous organism Physarum 
      polycephalum to examine the fate of core histones in G2 phase. We find rapid 
      exchange of H2A/H2B dimers with free pools that is greatly diminished by treatment 
      of the cells with alpha-amanitin. This exchange is enhanced in pol II-coding 
      sequences compared with extragenic regions or inactive loci. In contrast, H3/H4 
      tetramers exhibit far lower levels of exchange in the pol II-transcribed genes 
      tested, suggesting that tetramer exchange occurs via a distinct mechanism. However, 
      we find that transcribed regions of the ribosomal RNA gene loci exhibit rapid 
      exchange of H3/H4 tetramers. Thus, our data show that the majority of the pol II 
      transcription-dependent histone exchange is due to elongation in vivo rather than 
      promoter remodeling or other pol II-dependent alterations in promoter structure and, 
      in contrast to pol I, pol II transcription through nucleosomes in vivo causes facile 
      exchange of both H2A/H2B dimers while allowing conservation of epigenetic "marks" 
      and other post-translational modifications on H3 and H4.

TI  - Isolation of a new species of Physarum lysophosphatidic acid, PHYLPA, and its effect

PG  - 135-8
AB  - A new species of lysophosphatidic acid was isolated from myxoamoebae of a true slime 
      mold, Physarum polycephalum, and structural studies were performed. The purified 
      substance was subjected to nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), infrared 
      spectroscopy (IR), fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy (FAB/MS), alkaline 
      hydrolysis and tandem mass spectroscopy (MS/MS), and the results suggested this 
      substance to be lysophosphatidic acid composed of a cyclic phosphate and 
      cis-11,12-methylene octadecanoic acid. The effects of the LPA on DNA polymerases 
      were studied and compared with the effects of PHYLPA, which had been isolated as a 
      specific inhibitor of eukaryotic DNA polymerase alpha (6). It showed a specific 
      inhibitory activity on eukaryotic DNA polymerase alpha, but no activity on the 
      repair-type, or mitochondrial DNA polymerases.

TI  - [Effects of cytochalasin B upon mitosis of Physarum polycephalum].
PG  - 83-9
AB  - Cytochalasin B, known as a functional inhibitor of actin, was microinjected into 
      naturally synchronous plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum, and the mitotic behaviours 
      of both CB-treated specimens and the control were examined with light and electron 
      microscopy. Mitosis in the CB-treated specimens began about 20 to 60 minutes later 
      than that of the control. It was delayed 35 minutes in the specimens treated with CB 
      in the S phase of the cell cycle, and the delayed time was 20 minutes and 45 
      minutes, respectively. In the specimens treated with CB in early and middle G2 
      phase, the longest delay was 60 minutes found in the specimens treated in late G2 
      phase, indicating that mitosis was affected in Physarum polycephalum when the 
      function of actin was inhibited by CB treatment. The CB-treated specimens and the 
      control showed similarities in the process of mitosis and dynamic changes of nuclear 
      structures, suggesting that the main effect of CB treatment upon mitosis may be to 
      delay the triggering of the mitosis.

TI  - [The characteristics of PSCL32.5 protein from Physarum polycephalum and the 
      variation of the content through cell cycle].
PG  - 305-10
AB  - Crude fraction of Arg/Ser-rich proteins (SR proteins) were isolated from plasmodia 
      of Physarum polycephalum and immunoassayed by western blot with a monoclonal 
      antibody against SC35 protein from HeLa cell. Two polypeptides were detected by the 
      antibody, suggesting that they were SCL(SC35-like) proteins. The SCL proteins have 
      their mass weight of 32.5 kD and 82.5 kD, respectively, and so were termed PSCL32.5 
      and PSCL82.5 in this paper. The PI of PSCI32.5 was ascertained as 6.19 by IEF after 
      a further purification of the protein with SDS-PAGE. The densitometric scanning of 
      the western blot bands of PSCI32.5 isolated at different phases of cell cycle of P. 
      polycephalum demonstrated that the relative content of the protein varied through 
      the cell cycle: it appeared as the lowest at early S phase, showed increases from S 
      phase to G2 phase, and peaked at late G2 phase.

OAB - Every cell is probably able to respond to gravity (g) via an unknown gravireceptor 
      mechanism (supposed general gravisensitivity of cells). To investigate this 
      mechanism a free-living ameboid cell, which uses gravity for its spatial orientation 
      (geotaxis), was selected as a model system: the acellular slime mold Physarum 
      polycephalum (Myxomycetes). In this paper results of 0 g-simulation experiments will 
      be compared to results obtained in the Spacelab IML-1 Physarum experiment to stress 
      the reliability of experiments performed on the fast-rotating clinostat.

TI  - Intrinsic fluctuations of phosphoinositol levels are involved in the progression of 
      the naturally synchronous cell cycle in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 371-6
AB  - Using [3H]myo-inositol incorporation, changes in phosphoinositol (PI) metabolism at 
      different cell cycle stages in the myxomycete Physarum polycephalum were examined by 
      column chromatography. Two base levels for the inositol trisphosphate (IP3) fraction 
      were determined: a low one for S-phase and a higher one for G2 phase. Two transient 
      increases of IP3 were also observed, one in S-phase, 70 min after mitosis (no G1 
      phase in the Physarum cell cycle) and another in G2 phase, 90 min before mitosis. It 
      is concluded that the fluctuations in IP3 levels reflect endogenous events in the 
      cell cycle of Physarum, because they occurred in the absence of any exogenous 
      signals. Pulse treatment with Li+ (10 mM) at the points of the cell cycle, 
      characterized by the IP3 transients, had opposite effects: in early S-phase it 
      caused an acceleration while in late G2 phase it caused a prolongation of the cell 
      cycle duration. The pattern of Li(+)-induced changes in PI turnover is also 
      antagonistic: in most cases the IP3 level would decrease, however, Li+ prevents the 
      cell cycle-dependent reduction in IP3 concentration when applied at early S-phase. 
      The possible implications of the autogenous fluctuations in the IP3 fraction on the 
      progression of the cell cycle through several distinct checkpoints are discussed.

TI  - Biochemical and morphological characterization of the nuclear matrix during the

PG  - 1121-30
AB  - We have investigated biochemical and ultrastructural aspects of the nuclear matrix 
      during the naturally synchronous cell cycle of Physarum polycephalum. The morphology 
      of the in situ nuclear matrix exhibited significant cell cycle changes as revealed 
      by electron microscopic examination, especially during the progression of nuclei 
      through mitosis and S-phase. In mitosis the interchromatin matrix was found to be 
      retracted to the nuclear periphery; during S-phase this interchromatin matrix 
      gradually resembled, concomitant with the reconstruction of a nucleolar remnant 
      structure. During the G2-period no significant changes in matrix morphology were 
      observed. The pattern of nuclear matrix proteins was invariant during the cell 
      cycle; no cycle phase-specific proteins could be detected. In vivo labelling of 
      plasmodia with [35S]methionine/cysteine showed that only a few proteins are 
      synthesized and assembled into nuclear matrix structures in a cell cycle-dependent 
      way; the majority of proteins were synthesized almost continuously. This was also 
      shown for nuclear lamins homologues. In contrast to bulk nuclear histones, those 
      histones that remain tightly bound to the nuclear matrix were synthesized and 
      assembled into nuclear structures in the very first hour of S-phase; assembly was 
      terminated in mid-S-phase, indicating that nuclear matrix-bound chromatin is 
      replicated early in S-phase. Comparison of the acetylation pattern of matrix-bound 
      histone H4 with bulk nuclear H4 revealed a largely elevated acetate content of 
      matrix H4. The percentage of acetylated subspecies was entirely different from that 
      in bulk nuclear H4, indicating that matrix-associated histones represent a 
      subpopulation of nuclear histones with distinct properties, reflecting specific 
      structural requirements of matrix-attached chromatin.

AB  - A cellular slime mould Physarum polycephalum is a monstrously large single cell 
      visible by an unaided eye. The slime mold explores space in parallel, is guided by 
      gradients of chemoattractants, and propagates toward sources of nutrients along 
      nearly shortest paths. The slime mold is a living prototype of amorphous biological 
      computers and robotic devices capable of solving a range of tasks of graph 
      optimization and computational geometry. When presented with a distribution of 
      nutrients, the slime mold spans the sources of nutrients with a network of 
      protoplasmic tubes. This protoplasmic network matches a network of major transport 
      routes of a country when configuration of major urban areas is represented by 
      nutrients. A transport route connecting two cities should ideally be a shortest 
      path, and this is usually the case in computer simulations and laboratory 
      experiments with flat substrates. What searching strategies does the slime mold 
      adopt when exploring 3-D terrains? How are optimal and transport routes approximated 
      by protoplasmic tubes? Do the routes built by the slime mold on 3-D terrain match 
      real-world transport routes? To answer these questions, we conducted pioneer 
      laboratory experiments with Nylon terrains of USA and Germany. We used the slime 
      mold to approximate route 20, the longest road in USA, and autobahn 7, the longest 
      national motorway in Europe. We found that slime mold builds longer transport routes 
      on 3-D terrains, compared to flat substrates yet sufficiently approximates man-made 
      transport routes studied. We demonstrate that nutrients placed in destination sites 
      affect performance of slime mold, and show how the mold navigates around elevations. 
      In cellular automaton models of the slime mold, we have shown variability of the 
      protoplasmic routes might depends on physiological states of the slime mold. Results 
      presented will contribute toward development of novel algorithms for sensorial 
      fusion, information processing, and decision making, and will provide inspirations 
      in design of bioinspired amorphous robotic devices.

AB  - Computing devices are composed of spatial arrangements of simple fundamental logic 
      gates. These gates may be combined to form more complex adding circuits and, 
      ultimately, complete computer systems. Implementing classical adding circuits using 
      unconventional, or even living substrates such as slime mould Physarum polycephalum, 
      is made difficult and often impractical by the challenges of branching fan-out of 
      inputs and regions where circuit lines must cross without interference. In this 
      report we explore whether it is possible to avoid spatial propagation, branching and 
      crossing completely in the design of adding circuits. We analyse the input and 
      output patterns of a single-bit full adder circuit. A simple quantitative 
      transformation of the input patterns which considers the total number of bits in the 
      input string allows us to map the respective input combinations to the correct 
      outputs patterns of the full adder circuit, reducing the circuit combinations from a 
      2:1 mapping to a 1:1 mapping. The mapping of inputs to outputs also shows an 
      incremental linear progression, suggesting its implementation in a range of physical 
      systems. We demonstrate an example implementation, first in simulation, inspired by 
      self-oscillatory dynamics of the acellular slime mould P. polycephalum. We then 
      assess the potential implementation using plasmodium of slime mould itself. This 
      simple transformation may enrich the potential for using unconventional computing 
      substrates to implement digital circuits.

AB  - Spatiotemporal patterns in rings of coupled biological oscillators of the plasmodial 
      slime mold, Physarum polycephalum, were investigated by comparing with results 
      analyzed by the symmetric Hopf bifurcation theory based on group theory. In three-, 
      four-, and five-oscillator systems, all types of oscillation modes predicted by the 
      theory were observed including a novel oscillation mode, a half period oscillation, 
      which has not been reported anywhere in practical systems. Our results support the 
      effectiveness of the symmetric Hopf bifurcation theory in practical systems.

TI  - [A SC35-like protein is localized in the nucleus of Physarum polycephalum].
PG  - 177-82
AB  - After being labeled with an anti-SC35 antibody, the specimens of Physarum 
      polycephalum at S, G2, prophase, metaphase and ana-telophase were observed with an 
      Hitachi electron microscope and gold particles marking the location of the SC35-like 
      protein were mainly found in the nucleus,indicating the existence of a SC35-like 
      protein in it. Judging from the densities of the gold particles in the individual 
      domains of the nucleus, the SC35-like protein was principally located in the 
      nucleolar domain and interchromatin domain during G2 and prophase, and the protein 
      was distributed in the interchromosome domain at metaphase and ana-telophase when 
      the nucleus was disintegrated, suggesting that the nucleolus and interchromatin 
      (interchromosome) domain are the two main locations of the SC35-like protein in the 
      nucleus. Further observations upon the nucleolus revealed that the density of the 
      gold particles in the dense fibrillar component (DFC) of the nucleolus was much 
      higher than that of the fibrillar center (FC), demonstrating that the protein was 
      largely situated in the DFC rather than FC.

TI  - Selected BTB/POZ-kelch proteins bind ATP.
PG  - 20-6
AB  - Proteins with a bric-à-brac, tramtrack, broad-complex/Poxvirus zinc fingers 
      (BTB/POZ) domain are implicated in a broad variety of biological processes, 
      including DNA binding, regulation of gene transcription and organization of 
      macromolecular structures. Kelch domain containing BTB/POZ proteins like Mayven and 
      Keap1 display limited sequence similarity with the actin-fragmin kinase from 
      Physarum, a protein kinase with a kelch domain. We show that mouse Keap1, a 
      Caenorhabditis elegans protein that we named CKR, and human Mayven bind 
      5'-p-fluorosulfonyl-benzoyl-adenosine (FSBA), a covalently modifying ATP analogue. 
      Binding with 2-azido-ATP or ATP-Sepharose is also demonstrated. In contrast to 
      Mayven, FSBA binding by CKR and Keap1 was specifically inhibited by excess ATP. The 
      ATP binding pocket is located in the N-terminal half of Keap1. Our findings indicate 
      that several, but not all, BTB/POZ-kelch domain proteins possess an inconspicuous 
      ATP binding cassette.

      epithelial LLC-PK1 cell line. A comprehensive investigation of different preparation 
      procedures.
PG  - 573-80
AB  - Agarose-encapsulated nuclear matrix preparations of the lower eukaryote Physarum 
      polycephalum and the mammalian renal epithelial LLC-PK1 cell line were analyzed 
      after various experimental protocols with respect to the protein composition. The 
      effect of the mode of deproteinization (2 M NaCl, 0.25 M ammonium sulfate or 25 mM 
      lithium diiodosalicylate), presence of 2-mercaptoethanol, Ca2+, Cu2+, chelating 
      agents, the sequence of protein extraction and nuclease digestion, the use of RNase, 
      the temperature at which the experimental manipulations were performed and the use 
      of hypotonic or isotonic conditions was investigated. No significant differences in 
      the final nuclear matrix composition could be observed, regardless of the 
      experimental procedure applied. In Physarum, the major nuclear matrix proteins range 
      over 12-70 kDa with prominent bands at 24, 31, 37 and 45 kDa; the proteins of the 
      matrix in LLC-PK1 cells extend predominantly over 40-80 kDa. Furthermore, no 
      essential differences in the protein composition could be observed when type I and 
      type II nuclear matrices from the highly differentiated LLC-PK1 cell line were 
      compared. The same was found for analogous matrix preparations of Physarum. 
      Therefore, in both systems a distinction between type I/II matrix is questionable. 
      Immunoblotting of the matrix preparations with a variety of antibodies against 
      intermediate filament proteins and with antinuclear autoantibodies revealed the 
      presence of intermediate filament proteins as components of the nuclear matrix. We 
      conclude that the nuclear matrix represents a much more stable and reproducible 
      structure than has been proposed so far, largely independent of changes in the 
      preparation protocol.

TI  - Control of interaction strength in a network of the true slime mold by a 
      microfabricated structure.
PG  - 33-8
AB  - The plasmodium of the true slime mold, Physarum polycephalum, which shows various 
      nonlinear oscillatory phenomena, for example, in its thickness, protoplasmic 
      streaming and concentration of intracellular chemicals, can be regarded as a 
      collective of nonlinear oscillators. The plasmodial oscillators are interconnected 
      by microscale tubes whose dimensions can be closely related to the strength of 
      interaction between the oscillators. Investigation of the collective behavior of the 
      oscillators under the conditions in which the interaction strength can be 
      systematically controlled gives significant information on the characteristics of 
      the system. In this study, we proposed a living model system of a coupled oscillator 
      system in the Physarum plasmodium. We patterned the geometry and dimensions of the 
      microscale tube structure in the plasmodium by a microfabricated structure 
      (microstructure). As the first step, we constructed a two-oscillator system for the 
      plasmodium that has two wells (oscillator part) and a channel (coupling part). We 
      investigated the oscillation behavior by monitoring the thickness oscillation of the 
      plasmodium in the microstructure with various channel widths. It was found that the 
      oscillation behavior of two oscillators dynamically changed depending on the channel 
      width. Based on the results of measurements of the tube dimensions and the velocity 
      of the protoplasmic streaming in the tube, we discuss how the channel width relates 
      to the interaction strength of the coupled oscillator system.

TI  - Role of actin in the myosin-linked Ca(2+)-regulation of ATP-dependent interaction 
      between actin and myosin of a lower eukaryote, Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 508-13
AB  - Actin-activated ATPase activity of myosin from Physarum polycephalum decreases when 
      it binds Ca2+ and increases when it loses Ca2+. This Ca-inhibition is observed with 
      phosphorylated myosin [Kohama, K. (1990) Trend, Pharmacol. Sci. 11, 433-435]. The 
      activity of dephosphorylated myosin remained at a low level both in the presence and 
      absence of Ca2+, although Ca(2+)-binding ability was much the same as that of the 
      phosphorylated myosin. The effect of phosphorylation has been studied at a 
      conventional actin concentration, which is comparable with that of myosin by weight. 
      When the concentration of actin was increased by 10 times, the dephosphorylated 
      myosin became actin-activatable in the absence of Ca2+, and Ca-inhibition was 
      recovered. As actin exists quite abundantly in non-muscle cells of Physarum, myosin 
      phosphorylation plays virtually no role in regulating actin-myosin-ATP interaction 
      in vivo. Physiologically the interaction may be regulated by Ca2+ by binding to and 
      subsequent release from myosin. Latex beads coated by either phosphorylated or 
      dephosphorylated myosin moved ATP-dependently on the actin cables of Characeae cells 
      to the same extent in the absence of Ca2+, but the movement was abolished by 
      increasing Ca2+. When the interaction was examined by monitoring the movement of 
      actin filaments on myosin fixed on a coverslip, the movement and Ca-inhibition of 
      the movement were detected with phosphorylated, not dephosphorylated, myosin 
      [Okagaki, T., Higashi-Fujime, S., & Kohama, K. (1989) J. Biochem. 106,

AB  - The aim of this series of studies is to elucidate the role of mechanical stresses in 
      the processes of cell activation. The experiments were done with a huge unicellular 
      organism, the Physarum polycephalum plasmodium, which is a classical object in 
      studies of the nonmuscle motility. The contractile properties of this amoeboid cell 
      were investigated with the help of an inexpensive electronic-mechanical measuring 
      system. A short description of this device is presented, which allows one to 
      maintain a given kinetics of either the length or the load of the object and to 
      measure either its tension force or deformation, respectively, as a response. Some 
      examples of the longitudinal dynamics of the plasmodial strand and its activation 
      under periodic switching of regimes of measurement in certain phases of the 
      contraction-relaxation cycle are shown.

PG  - 704-12
AB  - Amoeboid locomotion of huge unicellular organism, the Physarum polycephalum 
      plasmodium, is stipulated by endoplasmic flow, which is produced by spatially highly 
      coordinated rhythmic contractions of the ectoplasm. To describe the 
      self-organization of the plasmodial contractile activity, we proposed a mathematical 
      model, which is based on the hypothesis of positive feedback between the deformation 
      of the cytoskeleton and release of a chemical regulator of the active contraction. A 
      nonautonomous analogue of this model was used to study the synchronization of 
      mechanochemical auto-oscillations by periodic gradient of the external pressure. 
      Numerical computations of the system of differential equations obtained revealed a 
      dependency of the synchronization band on the amplitude of the external pressure 
      oscillations. On the basis of this dependence and experimental data on the band of 
      synchronization of the shuttle endoplasmic flow by the periodic gradient of 
      temperature obtained with the help of the laser Doppler anemometer, relative 
      efficiency of external synchronizing action of temperature and pressure was 
      evaluated.

TI  - Beyond input-output computings: error-driven emergence with parallel non-distributed 
      slime mold computer.
PG  - 257-87
AB  - The emergence derived from errors is the key importance for both novel computing and 
      novel usage of the computer. In this paper, we propose an implementable experimental 
      plan for the biological computing so as to elicit the emergent property of complex 
      systems. An individual plasmodium of the true slime mold Physarum polycephalum acts 
      in the slime mold computer. Modifying the Elementary Cellular Automaton as it 
      entails the global synchronization problem upon the parallel computing provides the 
      NP-complete problem solved by the slime mold computer. The possibility to solve the 
      problem by giving neither all possible results nor explicit prescription of 
      solution-seeking is discussed. In slime mold computing, the distributivity in the 
      local computing logic can change dynamically, and its parallel non-distributed 
      computing cannot be reduced into the spatial addition of multiple serial computings. 
      The computing system based on exhaustive absence of the super-system may produce, 
      something more than filling the vacancy.

TI  - Is beta-poly(L-malate) synthesis catalysed by a combination of 
      beta-L-malyl-AMP-ligase and beta-poly(L-malate) polymerase?
PG  - 1085-90
AB  - beta-Poly(L-malate) is supposed to function in the storage and transport of 
      histones, DNA polymerases and other nuclear proteins in the giant syncytical cells 
      (plasmodia) of myxomycetes. Here we report on the biosynthesis of 
      [14C]beta-poly(L-malate) from injected L-[14C]malate in the plasmodium of Physarum 
      polycephalum. The effects of KCN, arsenate, adenosine 5'-(alpha, 
      beta-methylene)triphosphate, adenosine 5'-(beta, gamma-methylene)triphosphate, 
      guanosine 5'-(beta, gamma-methylene)triphosphate, desulfo coenzyme A and 
      phenylarsinoxid on beta-poly(L-malate) synthesis were studied after their 
      coinjection with L-[14C]malate. The synthesis was not affected by KCN or desulfo 
      coenzyme A, but was blocked by arsenate and adenosine 
      5'-(alpha,beta-methylene)triphosphate. The plasmodium lysate catalysed an 
      L-malate-dependent ATP-[32P]pyrophosphate exchange, but was devoid of 
      beta-poly(L-malate) synthetic activity under all experimental conditions tested. The 
      results suggested an extramitochondrial synthesis of beta-poly(L-malate), involving 
      the polymerization of beta-L-malyl-AMP. It is assumed that the lack of synthesis in 
      the lysate is caused by the inactivation of beta-poly(L-malate) polymerase involving 
      a cell injury kinase pathway. Because injected guanosine 5'-(beta, 
      gamma-methylene)triphosphate blocks the synthesis, the injury signal is likely to be 
      GTP dependent.

TI  - A developmental mutation (npfL1) resulting in cell death in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 2575-88
AB  - In Physarum, microscopic uninucleate amoebae develop into macroscopic multinucleate 
      plasmodia. In the mutant strain, RA614, plasmodium development is blocked. RA614 
      carries a recessive mutation (npfL1) in a gene that functions in sexual as well as 
      apogamic development. In npfL+ apogamic development, binucleate cells arise from 
      uninucleate cells by mitosis without cytokinesis at the end of an extended cell 
      cycle. In npfL1 cultures, apogamic development became abnormal at the end of the 
      extended cell cycle. The cells developed a characteristic rounded, vacuolated 
      appearance, nuclear fusion and vigorous cytoplasmic motion occurred, and the cells 
      eventually died. Nuclei were not visible by phase-contrast microscopy in most of the 
      abnormally developing cells, but fluorescence microscopy after DAPI staining 
      revealed intensely staining, condensed nuclei without nucleoli. Studies of tubulin 
      organization during npfL1 development indicated a high frequency of abnormal mitotic 
      spindles and, in some interphase cells, abnormally thick microtubules. Some of these 
      features were observed at low frequency in the parental npfL+ strain and may 
      represent a pathway of cell death, resembling apoptosis, that may be triggered in 
      more than one way. Nuclear fusion occurred during interphase and mitosis in npfL1 
      cells, and multipolar spindles were also observed. None of these features were 
      observed in npfL+ cells, suggesting that a specific effect of the npfL1 mutation may 
      be an incomplete alteration of nuclear structure from the amoebal to the plasmodial 
      state.

TI  - Physarum amoebae express a distinct fragmin-like actin-binding protein that controls 
      in vitro phosphorylation of actin by the actin-fragmin kinase.
PG  - 240-50
AB  - Amoebae and plasmodia constitute the two vegetative growth phases of the Myxomycete 
      Physarum. In vitro and in vivo phosphorylation of actin in plasmodia is tightly 
      controlled by fragmin P, a plasmodium-specific actin-binding protein that enables 
      actin phosphorylation by the actin-fragmin kinase. We investigated whether amoebal 
      actin is phosphorylated by this kinase, in spite of the lack of fragmin P. Strong 
      actin phosphorylation was detected only following addition of recombinant 
      actin-fragmin kinase to cell-free extracts of amoebae, suggesting that amoebae 
      contain a protein with properties similar to plasmodial fragmin. We purified the 
      complex between actin and this protein to homogeneity. Using an antibody that 
      specifically recognizes phosphorylated actin, we demonstrate that Thr203 in actin 
      can be phosphorylated in this complex. A full-length amoebal fragmin cDNA was cloned 
      and the deduced amino acid sequence shows 65% identity with plasmodial fragmin. 
      However, the fragmins are encoded by different genes. Northern blots using RNA from 
      a developing Physarum strain demonstrate that this fragmin isoform (fragmin A) is 
      not expressed in plasmodia. In situ localization showed that fragmin A is present 
      mainly underneath the plasma membrane. Our results indicate that Physarum amoebae 
      express a fragmin P-like isoform which shares the property of binding actin and 
      converting the latter into a substrate for the actin-fragmin kinase.

TI  - RNA editing of the coI mRNA throughout the life cycle of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 306-11
AB  - Editing of RNA via the insertion, deletion or substitution of genetic information 
      affects gene expression in a variety of systems. Previous characterization of the 
      Physarum polycephalum cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (coI) mRNA revealed that both 
      nucleotide insertions and base substitutions occur during the maturation of this 
      mitochondrial message. Both types of editing are known to be developmentally 
      regulated in other systems, including mammals and trypanosomatids. Here we show that 
      the coI mRNA present in Physarum mitochondria is edited via specific nucleotide 
      insertions and C to U conversions at every stage of the life cycle. Primer extension 
      sequencing of the RNA indicates that this editing is both accurate and efficient. 
      Using a sensitive RT-PCR assay to monitor the extent of editing at individual sites 
      of C insertion, we estimate that greater than 98% of the steady-state amount of coI 
      mRNA is edited throughout the Physarum developmental cycle.

TI  - [RNA editing in different genetic systems].
PG  - 52-73
AB  - One of the significant amendments to the central dogma of the molecular biology was 
      the discovery of the RNA editing process in different genetic systems. Whereas other 
      forms of co- and posttranscriptional modifications of messenger RNA (mRNA) (capping, 
      polyadenilation, splicing) retain the correspondence of the primary structure of 
      exon and final transcript, RNA editing disturbs this correspondence changing the 
      primary structure of mRNA after its transcription. The variants of RNA-editing 
      mechanisms are various and include site-specific insertions and deletions of one or 
      several nucleotides (insertion-deletion editing) as well as specific modifications 
      of nucleosides such as C-->U and A-->I deamination or U-->C transamination 
      (conversion editing). These mechanisms differ greatly in different genetic systems 
      but they always result in synthesis of functionally valuable proteins from 
      "incorrect" genes and, correspondingly, can play a significant role in regulation of 
      their expression.

TI  - Microtubules are required in amoeba chemotaxis for preferential stabilization of 
      appropriate pseudopods.
PG  - 2071-9
AB  - Amoebae of Physarum polycephalum exhibit chemotactic responses to glucose and to 
      cAMP. The chemotaxing amoebae exhibit alternating locomotive movements: relatively 
      linear locomotion and movements that change the direction of the locomotion. Such 
      locomotive activity is tightly coupled with the changes in the number and the 
      positions of the pseudopods; cells have one pseudopod at the leading edge during 
      their linear locomotion, while they have multiple pseudopods when they are changing 
      the direction of locomotion. Treatment of cells with microtubule-disrupting reagents 
      inhibited the chemotaxis of the cells. To characterize the role of the microtubule 
      system in chemotaxis, we quantitatively analyzed the relationship between the 
      positions of multiple pseudopods of the amoebae and the relative stability of the 
      pseudopods during reorientation. No significant differences were observed in the 
      pseudopod dynamics between the untreated and the treated amoebae. In both cases, one 
      pseudopod at the leading edge continued to expand during linear locomotion. It then 
      split into two to three pseudopods in the reorientation phase, and the positions of 
      the multiple pseudopods were random. Among multiple pseudopods, however, the 
      pseudopods closer to the microneedle tip were selectively stabilized more often than 
      those distant from the tip in the presence of the microtubule system. By contrast, 
      such preferential stabilization of the appropriate pseudopods was completely 
      abolished by microtubule inhibitors. The microtubule-dependent selection of 
      appropriately located pseudopods enables amoebae to turn correctly at the 
      reorientation step.

TI  - Minimum-risk path finding by an adaptive amoebal network.
PG  - 068104
AB  - When two food sources are presented to the slime mold Physarum in the dark, a thick 
      tube for absorbing nutrients is formed that connects the food sources through the 
      shortest route. When the light-avoiding organism is partially illuminated, however, 
      the tube connecting the food sources follows a different route. Defining risk as the 
      experimentally measurable rate of light-avoiding movement, the minimum-risk path is 
      exhibited by the organism, determined by integrating along the path. A model for an 
      adaptive-tube network is presented that is in good agreement with the experimental 
      observations.

TI  - Kinetic analysis of a signal-transduction pathway by time-resolved somatic 
      complementation of mutants.
PG  - 1991-9
AB  - Sensory control of sporulation in Physarum polycephalum plasmodia is mediated by a 
      branched signal-transduction pathway that integrates blue light, far-red light, heat 
      shock and the starvation state. Mutants defective in the pathway were isolated and 
      three phenotypes obtained: blue-blind, general-blind and light-independent 
      sporulating. When plasmodia of the blue-blind mutant Blu1 were exposed to a pulse of 
      blue light and subsequently fused to non-induced wild-type plasmodia, the resulting 
      heterokaryons sporulated, indicating a functional blue- light photoreceptor in the 
      mutant. When the general-blind mutant Nos1 was fused to a wild-type plasmodium which 
      had been induced by light, sporulation of the heterokaryon was blocked. However, the 
      dominant inhibition of sporulation by Nos1 was gradually lost with increasing time 
      between induction by light and time of fusion, suggesting that Nos1 can be bypassed 
      by the time-dependent formation of a downstream signal-transduction intermediate. 
      Phenotype expression in constitutively sporulating (Cos) mutants depended on 
      starvation. The Cos2 product was titrated by fusing mutant plasmodia of different 
      sizes to wild-type plasmodia of constant size and analysing the sporulation 
      probability of the resulting heterokaryon. The titration curve indicates that a 
      small change in the amount of Cos2 product can cause sporulation. We conclude that 
      somatic complementation analysis allows the time-resolved evaluation of the 
      regulatory function of mutations in a signal-transduction pathway without prior 
      cloning of the gene. This shortcut allows us to characterize many mutants quickly 
      and to select those for molecular analysis that display a well-defined regulatory 
      function.

AB  - The true slime mold Physarum polycephalum, a single-celled amoeboid organism, is 
      capable of efficiently allocating a constant amount of intracellular resource to its 
      pseudopod-like branches that best fit the environment where dynamic light stimuli 
      are applied. Inspired by the resource allocation process, the authors formulated a 
      concurrent search algorithm, called the Tug-of-War (TOW) model, for maximizing the 
      profit in the multi-armed Bandit Problem (BP). A player (gambler) of the BP should 
      decide as quickly and accurately as possible which slot machine to invest in out of 
      the N machines and faces an "exploration-exploitation dilemma." The dilemma is a 
      trade-off between the speed and accuracy of the decision making that are conflicted 
      objectives. The TOW model maintains a constant intracellular resource volume while 
      collecting environmental information by concurrently expanding and shrinking its 
      branches. The conservation law entails a nonlocal correlation among the branches, 
      i.e., volume increment in one branch is immediately compensated by volume 
      decrement(s) in the other branch(es). Owing to this nonlocal correlation, the TOW 
      model can efficiently manage the dilemma. In this study, we extend the TOW model to 
      apply it to a stretched variant of BP, the Extended Bandit Problem (EBP), which is a 
      problem of selecting the best M-tuple of the N machines. We demonstrate that the 
      extended TOW model exhibits better performances for 2-tuple-3-machine and 
      2-tuple-4-machine instances of EBP compared with the extended versions of well-known 
      algorithms for BP, the ϵ-Greedy and SoftMax algorithms, particularly in terms of its 
      short-term decision-making capability that is essential for the survival of the 
      amoeba in a hostile environment.

AB  - In Physarum polycephalum several degrees of organisation of deoxyribonucleoprotein 
      fibres were found. The complexes of histones and the DNA duplex seem to "be packed" 
      at first into a 100 A fibre and then into a 200 A fibre of DNP. In Ph. polycephalum 
      the electrophoretic mobilities of histone fractions 4 and 6 are comparable to that 
      of fractions f3/f2b and f2a1 of calf thymus, resp. Histone fractions 3 and 5 move a 
      bit faster than fractions f1 and f2a2, resp. Thus, the myxomycete P. polycephalum is 
      similar to higher eukaryotes as concerns the ultrastructure of chromatin and 
      electrophoretic properties of histones.

      phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylinositol 
      (PI), as well as their contents in the cells during synchronous growth of the 
      myxomycete, Physarum polycephalum, have been studied. It has been found that both 
      the phospholipid levels and the rates of 32Pi incorporation increase during the S 
      phase till the early G2 phase, remain nearly constant during the G2 phase and fall 
      to the initial level at the end of the G2 phase and in mitosis. It has been revealed 
      that the rate of 32Pi incorporation into PC is very low compared to PE and PI, in 
      spite of the fact that the PC level is the highest. The possible reasons of this 
      phenomenon are discussed.

TI  - Gravisensitivity of the acellular slime mold Physarum polycephalum demonstrated on 
      the fast-rotating clinostat.
PG  - 44-50
AB  - The acellular slime mold Physarum polycephalum was used to investigate a postulated 
      general gravisensitivity of cells. Physarum was subjected i) to a rotation on the 
      fast-rotating clinostat, which enables the simulation of weightlessness (0 g), and 
      ii) to single horizontal turns of 180 degrees. On the fast-rotating clinostat the 
      response consists of a frequency increase in radial contractile activity, an 
      oscillation of the mean values (frequency regulation phenomena) and an increase in 
      standard deviation. A combination of 0 g and respiration impediment inhibits the 
      response to 0 g, i. e., the frequency increase in radial contractile activity during 
      weightlessness simulation. Turning the specimens horizontally about 180 degrees in a 
      normally positioned light microscope also leads to a frequency increase in radial 
      contractile activity, but the temporal pattern of the frequency increase differs in 
      comparison to the experiments performed on the clinostat during weightlessness 
      simulation. These results demonstrate the occurrence of gravisensitivity in Physarum 
      polvcephalum. Regulation phenomena and the possible role of mitochondria in 
      graviperception are discussed.

AB  - The cytoplasms of ameboid cells are nonlinearly viscous. The cell controls this 
      viscosity by modulating the amount, localization and interactions of bio-polymers. 
      Here we investigated how the nonlinearity infers the cellular behaviors and whether 
      nonlinearity-specific behaviors exist. We modeled the developed plasmodium of the 
      slime mold Physarum polycephalum as a network of branching tubes and examined the 
      linear and nonlinear viscous cytoplasm flows in the tubes. We found that the 
      nonlinearity in the cytoplasm׳s viscosity induces a novel type of symmetry breaking 
      in the protoplasmic flow. We also show that symmetry breaking can play an important 
      role in adaptive behaviors, namely, connection of behavioral modes implemented on 
      different time scales and transportation of molecular signals from the front to the 
      rear of the cell during cellular locomotion.

TI  - Structural and enzymatic characterization of physarolisin (formerly physaropepsin) 
      proves that it is a unique serine-carboxyl proteinase.
PG  - 1023-9
AB  - Previously, we purified and partially characterized physarolisin, a lysosomal acid 
      proteinase from Physarum polycephalum, which had been suggested to be concerned with 
      the morphological changes of the mold. In this study, a cDNA for the enzyme was 
      cloned and sequenced, and the structural and enzymatic features were investigated. 
      The enzyme shows a sequence similarity to the serine-carboxyl proteinase family 
      (MEROPS S53). Indeed, diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) was shown to strongly inhibit 
      the activity of the enzyme. However, the enzyme possesses several unique features 
      distinct from the other members of the family, such as the two-chain structure and 
      inhibition by diazoacetyl-D,L-norleucine methyl ester (DAN). The sites and mode of 
      processing of the precursor to the mature enzyme were deduced, and the major 
      DAN-reactive residue in the enzyme was identified to be Asp529. These features were 
      suggested to be due to the unique local tertiary structure of the enzyme by 
      molecular modeling. We now propose the name physarolisin for the enzyme.

TI  - Tropomyosin is localized in the nuclear matrix and chromosome scaffold of Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 61-9
AB  - The nuclei and chromosomes were isolated from plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum. 
      The nuclear matrix and chromosome scaffold were obtained after the DNA and most of 
      the proteins were extracted with DNase I and 2 M NaCl. SDS-PAGE analyses revealed 
      that the nuclear matrix and chromosome scaffold contained a 37 kD polypeptide which 
      is equivalent to tropomyosin in molecular weight. Immunofluorescence observations 
      upon slide preparations labeled with anti-tropomyosin antibody showed that the 
      nuclear matrix and chromosome scaffold emanated bright fluorescence, suggesting the 
      presence of the antigen in them. Immunodotting results confirmed the presence of 
      tropomyosin in the nuclear matrix and chromosome scaffold. Immunoelectron 
      microscopic observations further demonstrated that tropomyosin was dispersively 
      distributed in the interphase nuclei and metaphase chromosomes.

TI  - Physarum actin is phosphorylated as the actin-fragmin complex at residues Thr203 and 
      Thr202 by a specific 80 kDa kinase.
PG  - 3185-91
AB  - The Physarum EGTA-resistant actin-fragmin complex, previously named cap 42(a+b), is 
      phosphorylated in the actin subunit by an endogenous kinase [Maruta and Isenberg 
      (1983) J. Biol. Chem., 258, 10151-10158]. This kinase has been purified and 
      characterized. It is an 80 kDa monomeric enzyme, unaffected by known kinase 
      regulators. Staurosporine acts as a potent inhibitor. The actin-fragmin complex is 
      the preferred substrate. The phosphorylation is inhibited by micromolar Ca2+ 
      concentrations, but only in the presence of additional actin. Polymerized actin 
      (vertebrate muscle and non-muscle isoforms) and actin complexes with various 
      actin-binding proteins are poorly phosphorylated. The heterotrimer consisting of two 
      actins and one fragmin, which is formed from cap 42(a+b) and actin in the presence 
      of micromolar concentrations of Ca2+, is also a poor substrate. From the other 
      substrates tested, only histones were significantly phosphorylated, in particular 
      histone H1. In the same manner, casein kinase I could also phosphorylate the 
      actin-fragmin complex. The major phosphorylation site in actin is Thr203. A second 
      minor site is Thr202. These residues constitute one of the contact sites for DNase I 
      [Kabsch et al. (1990) Nature, 347, 37-44] and are also part of one of the predicted 
      actin-actin contact sites in the F-actin model [Holmes et al. (1990) Nature, 347, 
      44-49].

TI  - Chromosomal proteins of Physarum polycephalum with preferential affinity for the 
      sequence, poly d(A-T).poly d(A-T).
PG  - 105-15
AB  - We have identified two novel chromosomal proteins from Physarum polycephalum using a 
      protein blotting DNA-binding assay. A fraction of these proteins was readily 
      released from nuclei by solutions of moderate ionic strength (0.15 N-0.35 M NaCl) or 
      mild nuclease treatment and appear associated with chromatin that is 
      nucleosome-free. A significant proportion of these proteins, however, was not 
      released from nuclei by solutions of high ionic strength (1.6 M NaCl) or treatment 
      with excess nuclease. These results suggest that these chromosomal proteins are 
      distributed between transcriptionally-competent and inert domains of chromatin. Both 
      proteins preferentially and tenaciously bound duplex DNA, especially to the 
      alternating B-DNA conformation displayed by the synthetic sequence, poly d(A-T).poly 
      d(A-T).

TI  - A survey of PPR proteins identifies DYW domains like those of land plant RNA editing 
      factors in diverse eukaryotes.

AB  - The pentatricopeptide repeat modules of PPR proteins are key to their 
      sequence-specific binding to RNAs. Gene families encoding PPR proteins are greatly 
      expanded in land plants where hundreds of them participate in RNA maturation, mainly 
      in mitochondria and chloroplasts. Many plant PPR proteins contain additional 
      carboxyterminal domains and have been identified as essential factors for specific 
      events of C-to-U RNA editing, which is abundant in the two endosymbiotic plant 
      organelles. Among those carboxyterminal domain additions to plant PPR proteins, the 
      so-called DYW domain is particularly interesting given its similarity to cytidine 
      deaminases. The frequency of organelle C-to-U RNA editing and the diversity of 
      DYW-type PPR proteins correlate well in plants and both were recently identified 
      outside of land plants, in the protist Naegleria gruberi. Here we present a 
      systematic survey of PPR protein genes and report on the identification of 
      additional DYW-type PPR proteins in the protists Acanthamoeba castellanii, 
      Malawimonas jakobiformis, and Physarum polycephalum. Moreover, DYW domains were also 
      found in basal branches of multi-cellular lineages outside of land plants, including 
      the alga Nitella flexilis and the rotifers Adineta ricciae and Philodina roseola. 
      Intriguingly, the well-characterized and curious patterns of mitochondrial RNA 
      editing in the slime mold Physarum also include examples of C-to-U changes. Finally, 
      we identify candidate sites for mitochondrial RNA editing in Malawimonas, further 
      supporting a link between DYW-type PPR proteins and C-to-U editing, which may have 
      remained hitherto unnoticed in additional eukaryote lineages.

TI  - Nuclear accumulation and homeostasis of the unusual polymer beta-poly (L-malate) in 
      plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 373-80
AB  - The plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum specifically contains an unusual polyester, 
      beta-poly(L-malate), which is not found in any of the mononucleate forms of its life 
      cycle. Plasmodia growing on D-glucose have been analyzed for beta-poly(L-malate) in 
      nuclei, cytosol and culture medium after cell fractionation, purification by 
      chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and digestion of proteins/nucleic acids. Nuclei 
      contained 400 micrograms polymer per 1 g of plasmodia, corresponding to a nuclear 
      concentration of 230 mM L-malyl residues, not depending on growth rates, lengths of 
      growth periods, and the growth form as micro- or macroplasmodia. The synthetic rate 
      increased during the phase of rapid enlargement of the nuclei after mitosis. 
      Beta-Poly(L-malate) was polydisperse in molecular mass, these tending to be higher 
      in nuclear than in cytosolic extracts and being lowest in the culture medium. 
      Beta-Poly(L-malate) was not degraded when contained in plasmodia, in contrast to 
      degradation and the occurrence of low molecular mass polymer in the culture medium. 
      During pulse-chase feeding with D-[14C]glucose (0.8 micrometerCi/mol), 
      beta-[14C]poly(L-malate) appearance followed kinetics indicating a release of 
      polymer from nuclei into the culture medium when it was in excess of a threshold. 
      Injection experiments with purified beta-[14C]poly(L-malate) revealed a re-entry 
      from the cytoplasm into the nuclei and thus the possibility of commutation between 
      the cytoplasm and the nuclei. The observed homeostasis in nuclei supports the 
      assumption that beta-poly(L-malate) plays an essential role in growing plasmodia.

TI  - Stability of a homo-dimeric Ca(2+)-binding member of the beta gamma-crystallin 
      superfamily: DSC measurements on spherulin 3a from Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 1147-53
AB  - Spherulin 3a (S3a) from Physarum polycephalum represents the only known 
      single-domain member of the superfamily of beta gamma eye-lens crystallins. It 
      shares the typical two Greek-key motif and is stabilized by dimerization and 
      Ca(2+)-binding. The temperature and denaturant-induced unfolding of S3a in the 
      absence and in the presence of Ca2+ were investigated by differential scanning 
      calorimetry and fluorescence spectroscopy. To accomplish reversibility without 
      chemical modification of the protein during thermal denaturation, the only cysteine 
      residue (Cys4) was substituted by serine; apart from that, the protein was 
      destabilized by adding 0.5-1.8 M guanidinium chloride (GdmCl). The Cys4Ser mutant 
      was found to be indistinguishable from natural S3a. The equilibrium unfolding 
      transitions obey the two-state model according to N2-->2 U, allowing thermodynamic 
      parameters to be determined by linear extrapolation to zero GdmCl concentration. The 
      corresponding transition temperatures TM for the Ca(2+)-free and Ca(2+)-loaded 
      protein were found to be 65 and 85 degrees C, the enthalpy changes delta Hcal, 800 
      and 1280 kJ/mol(dimer), respectively. The strong dependencies of TM and delta Hcal 
      on the GdmCl concentration allow the molar heat capacity change delta Cp to be 
      determined. As a result, delta Cp = 18 kJ/(K mol(dimer)) was calculated independent 
      of Ca2+. No significant differences were obtained between the free energy delta G 
      degree calculated from delta Hcal and TM, and extrapolated from the stability curves 
      in the presence of different amounts of denaturant. The free energy derived from 
      thermal unfolding was confirmed by the spectral results obtained from GdmCl-induced 
      equilibrium transitions at different temperatures for the Ca(2+)-free or the 
      Ca(2+)-loaded protein, respectively. Within the limits of error, the delta G degree 
      values extrapolated from the transitions of chemical denaturation to zero denaturant 
      concentration are identical with the calorimetric results.

TI  - Effects of fluorodeoxyuridine and nalidixic acid on the activity of topoisomerase I 
      in plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 1303-6
AB  - 1. A regulatory coupling between the rate of cellular transcription and the activity 
      of topoisomerase I was investigated in plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum treated 
      with fluorodeoxyuridine or nalidixic acid. 2. Fluorodeoxyuridine at concentrations 
      above 40 micrograms/ml lowered both the incorporation of [3H]uridine and the 
      activity of topoisomerase I to 10% of corresponding control values. 3. Nalidixic 
      acid, in the range of concentrations between 20-50 micrograms/ml did not inhibit the 
      incorporation of [3H]uridine but lowered the activity of topoisomerase I by about 
      half. 4. It is suggested that a coupling between the level of transcription and the 
      activity of topoisomerase I in Physarum plasmodia involves only about a half of the 
      topoisomerase I activity and is limited to transcription occurring on ribosomal 
      genes.

TI  - The two alleles of the hapP gene in Physarum polycephalum code for different 
      proteins.
PG  - 271-4
AB  - Many mRNAs show cell-type specific expression in the acellular slime mold Physarum 
      polycephalum. The most abundant plasmodial-specific mRNA (hapP) encodes a small 
      hydrophobic protein of 187 amino acids that contains a potential signal peptide. 
      Southern hybridizations using the hapP cDNA showed that the hapP gene is a single 
      copy gene with two alleles, hapP1 and hapP2. The alleles have restriction enzyme 
      polymorphisms. The nucleotide sequence of the coding region of the hapP1 allele was 
      obtained from a genomic clone, and the nucleotide sequence of the hapP2 allele was 
      obtained from a cDNA clone. The hapP1 and hapP2 alleles code for proteins that are 
      9.6% different in amino acid sequence. All differences are found in the central 
      region of the protein. The nucleotide sequences of the first and last exons, which 
      contain coding and non-coding regions, are identical. PCR amplification of cDNAs 
      (RT-PCR) showed that both alleles are expressed in the same cell.

TI  - A comparative study of histone deacetylases of plant, fungal and vertebrate cells.
PG  - 181-8
AB  - The enzymatic equilibrium of reversible core histone acetylation is maintained by 
      two enzyme activities, histone acetyltransferase and histone deacetylase (HD). These 
      enzyme activities exist as multiple enzyme forms. The present report describes 
      methods to extract different HD-forms from three organisms, germinating maize 
      embryos, the myxomycete Physarum polycephalum, and chicken red blood cells; it 
      provides data on the chromatographic separation and partial purification of 
      HD-forms. In germinating maize embryos three HDs (HD1-A, HD1-B, HD2) can be 
      discriminated; HD1-A, HD1-B, and HD2 were characterized in terms of their dependence 
      on pH, temperature and various ions, as well as kinetic parameters (Km for core 
      histones) and inhibition by various compounds. The same parameters were investigated 
      for the corresponding enzymes of Physarum polycephalum, and mature and immature 
      chicken erythrocytes. Based on these results, optimum assay conditions were 
      established for the different enzyme forms. The kinetic data revealed that the maize 
      histone deacetylase HD1-B peak after partial purification by Q-Sepharose 
      chromatography was heterogeneous and consisted of two histone binding sites that 
      differed significantly in their affinity for purified core histones. Optimized 
      affinity chromatography on poly-Lysine Agarose indeed showed that the former defined 
      deacetylase HD1-B can be separated clearly into two individual HD enzyme forms. The 
      high multiplicity of histone deacetylases underlines the importance of these enzymes 
      for the complex regulation of core histone acetylation.

      yeast-ARS-consensus sequence. The repetition frequency of the described sequence is 
      about 3000 to 7000, a number that would fit with the distribution of replicator 
      segments in Physarum.

TI  - Material approximation of data smoothing and spline curves inspired by slime mould.
PG  - 036016
LID - 10.1088/1748-3182/9/3/036016 [doi]
AB  - The giant single-celled slime mould Physarum polycephalum is known to approximate a 
      number of network problems via growth and adaptation of its protoplasmic transport 
      network and can serve as an inspiration towards unconventional, material-based 
      computation. In Physarum, predictable morphological adaptation is prevented by its 
      adhesion to the underlying substrate. We investigate what possible computations 
      could be achieved if these limitations were removed and the organism was free to 
      completely adapt its morphology in response to changing stimuli. Using a particle 
      model of Physarum displaying emergent morphological adaptation behaviour, we 
      demonstrate how a minimal approach to collective material computation may be used to 
      transform and summarise properties of spatially represented datasets. We find that 
      the virtual material relaxes more strongly to high-frequency changes in data, which 
      can be used for the smoothing (or filtering) of data by approximating moving average 
      and low-pass filters in 1D datasets. The relaxation and minimisation properties of 
      the model enable the spatial computation of B-spline curves (approximating splines) 
      in 2D datasets. Both clamped and unclamped spline curves of open and closed shapes 
      can be represented, and the degree of spline curvature corresponds to the relaxation 
      time of the material. The material computation of spline curves also includes novel 
      quasi-mechanical properties, including unwinding of the shape between control points 
      and a preferential adhesion to longer, straighter paths. Interpolating splines could 
      not directly be approximated due to the formation and evolution of Steiner points at 
      narrow vertices, but were approximated after rectilinear pre-processing of the 
      source data. This pre-processing was further simplified by transforming the original 
      data to contain the material inside the polyline. These exemplary results expand the 
      repertoire of spatially represented unconventional computing devices by 
      demonstrating a simple, collective and distributed approach to data and curve 
      smoothing.

AB  - Well-known immunization strategies, based on degree centrality, betweenness 
      centrality, or closeness centrality, either neglect the structural significance of a 
      node or require global information about the network. We propose a biologically 
      inspired immunization strategy that circumvents both of these problems by 
      considering the number of links of a focal node and the way the neighbors are 
      connected among themselves. The strategy thus measures the dependence of the 
      neighbors on the focal node, identifying the ability of this node to spread the 
      disease. Nodes with the highest ability in the network are the first to be 
      immunized. To test the performance of our method, we conduct numerical simulations 
      on several computer-generated and empirical networks, using the 
      susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model. The results show that the proposed 
      strategy largely outperforms the existing well-known strategies.

TI  - No editing of mitochondrial plasmid transcripts in mitochondria of Physarum that 
      have an RNA-editing system.
PG  - 67-71
AB  - Two types of RNA editing have been reported in the mitochondria of Physarum; 
      extensive insertions of nucleotides and single-base substitutions. In the Ng strain 
      of P. polycephalum and its derivatives, mitochondria have a specific plasmid (mF) 
      that promotes fusion of mitochondria. We examined the editing of transcripts derived 
      from the mF plasmid. For analysis, we selected three regions of the plasmid, 
      including a DNA fragment that corresponded to missing conserved domains of the RNA 
      polymerase. In contrast to the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), no RNA editing of the 
      transcripts of the mF plasmid was detected. Our results suggest that the mechanism 
      of transcription of the mitochondrial plasmid is independent of that of mtDNA, 
      indicating that the plasmid has a different evolutionary origin from the mtDNA.

PG  - 299-302
AB  - A second ras homologue, designated Ppras2, has been isolated from Physarum 
      polycephalum mixed amoebae and flagellates cDNA library. Ppras2 encodes a protein of 
      193 amino acids of a calculated M(r) of 21,633. The deduced amino acid sequence is 
      highly homologous to Ppras1 and other ras genes from slime molds. The amino acid 
      sequence at the C-terminus of the putative protein suggests that like other slime 
      mold ras proteins but not the ones from other organisms, it is modified by 
      geranylgeranylation rather than farnesylation, it is unpalmitoylated and contains a 
      putative lysine-rich domain.

TI  - Flow-induced channel formation in the cytoplasm of motile cells.
PG  - 016310
AB  - A model is presented to explain the development of flow channels within the 
      cytoplasm of the plasmodium of the giant amoeba Physarum polycephalum. The formation 
      of channels is related to the development of a self-organizing tubular network in 
      large cells. Experiments indicate that the flow of cytoplasm is involved in the 
      development and organization of these networks, and the mathematical model proposed 
      here is motivated by recent experiments involving the observation of development of 
      flow channel in small cells. A model of pressure-driven flow through a polymer 
      network is presented in which the rate of flow increases the rate of 
      depolymerization. Numerical solutions and asymptotic analysis of the model in one 
      spatial dimension show that under very general assumptions this model predicts the 
      formation of channels in response to flow.

TI  - Kinetic and thermodynamic stabilization of the betagamma-crystallin homolog

PG  - 701-5
AB  - Globular proteins may be stabilized, either intrinsically, at the various levels of 
      the structural hierarchy, or extrinsically, by ligand binding. In the case of the 
      dormant all-beta protein spherulin 3a (S3a) from the slime mold Physarum 
      polycephalum, binding of calcium ions causes extreme kinetic and thermodynamic 
      stabilization. S3a is the only known single-domain member of the two Greek key 
      superfamily of betagamma-crystallins sharing the extreme long-term stability of its 
      homologs in vertebrate eye lens. Spectral analysis allows two Ca2+-binding sites 
      with KD=9 microM and 200 microM to be distinguished. Unfolding in the absence and in 
      the presence of Ca2+gives evidence for extreme kinetic stabilization of the protein: 
      In the absence of Ca2+, the half-time of unfolding in 2. 5 M guanidinium chloride 
      (GdmCl) equals 8.3 minutes, whereas in the presence of Ca2+, even in 7.5 M GdmCl, it 
      exceeds nine hours. To reach the equilibrium of unfolding in the absence and in the 
      presence of Ca2+takes one day and eight weeks, respectively. The corresponding Gibbs 
      free energies (based on the two-state model) are 77 and 135 kJ/mol. Saturation of 
      S3a with Ca2+leads to an upward shift of the temperature-induced equilibrium 
      transition by ca 20 deg. C. The in situ Ca2+concentration in the spherules is 
      sufficient for the complete complexation of S3a in vivo.

AB  - Effect of pulse treatments of cordycepin, an analog of adenosine, on S and G2 phases 
      of the cell cycle of the mitotically synchronous plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum 
      has been studied. Various concentrations of the drug (50-200 micrograms ml-1) were 
      found to be effective in delaying mitosis by several hours in both the phases. 
      However, there was a significant increase in mitotic delay in those treated during 
      G2. It is suggested that this extra delay during G2 could be due to the 
      transcriptive level inhibition of specific RNA types, such as that of tubulins, 
      whose gene activity is cell cycle regulated and turned on during G2 in Physarum, or 
      alternatively because of a deficiency for ATP and the consequent inhibition of 
      events such as mitotic spindle assembly and phosphorylation of histones.

TI  - Screening for beta-poly(L-malate) binding proteins by affinity chromatography.
PG  - 1119-27
AB  - Poly(beta-L-malic acid) is a cell type-specific polymer of myxomycetes (true slime 
      molds) with the physiological role to organize mobility of certain proteins over the 
      giant multinucleated plasmodia. We have developed an affinity chromatography 
      employing 1,6-diamino-n-hexane-Sepharose-coupled poly(malic acid) to identify such 
      proteins in cellular extracts of Physarum polycephalum. Molecular masses were 
      measured by SDS-PAGE and non-denaturing PAGE after silver staining and/or Western 
      blotting. Protein complexes/subunits were detected by 2-dimensional non-denaturing 
      PAGE/SDS-PAGE. A simplified gel shift experiment displayed binding to fragmented 
      calf thymus DNA. Nuclei were richest in poly(malate) binding proteins followed by 
      cytoplasm and membranes. A protein of 370 kDa dissociated into 11 subunits of 11-29 
      kDa, indicative of a highly complex protein. This and other proteins displayed 
      binding to nucleic acid in gel shift experiments. Poly(malate) is considered a 
      structural and functional equivalent of long contiguous aspartate repeats in 
      proteins of eukaryotes.

TI  - Computational screen for spliceosomal RNA genes aids in defining the phylogenetic 
      distribution of major and minor spliceosomal components.
PG  - 3001-10
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkn142 [doi]
AB  - The RNA molecules of the spliceosome are critical for specificity and catalysis 
      during splicing of eukaryotic pre-mRNA. In order to examine the evolution and 
      phylogenetic distribution of these RNAs, we analyzed 149 eukaryotic genomes 
      representing a broad range of phylogenetic groups. RNAs were predicted using 
      high-sensitivity local alignment methods and profile HMMs in combination with 
      covariance models. The results provide the most comprehensive view so far of the 
      phylogenetic distribution of spliceosomal RNAs. RNAs were predicted in many 
      phylogenetic groups where these RNA were not previously reported. Examples are RNAs 
      of the major (U2-type) spliceosome in all fungal lineages, in lower metazoa and many 
      protozoa. We also identified the minor (U12-type) spliceosomal U11 and U6atac RNAs 
      in Acanthamoeba castellanii, where U12 spliceosomal RNA as well as minor introns 
      were reported recently. In addition, minor-spliceosome-specific RNAs were identified 
      in a number of phylogenetic groups where previously such RNAs were not observed, 
      including the nematode Trichinella spiralis, the slime mold Physarum polycephalum 
      and the fungal lineages Zygomycota and Chytridiomycota. The detailed map of the 
      distribution of the U12-type RNA genes supports an early origin of the minor 
      spliceosome and points to a number of occasions during evolution where it was lost.

TI  - Phytochrome-induced expression of lig1, a homologue of the fission yeast cell-cycle 
      checkpoint gene hus1, is associated with the developmental switch in Physarum 
      polycephalum plasmodia.
PG  - 86-93
AB  - Lig1 was found in a differential-display screen for early genes expressed during 
      phytochrome-controlled sporulation of Physarum polycephalum plasmodia. A stretch of 
      218 amino acids of the predicted sequence of Lig1 shares 32% sequence identity to 
      that of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe cell-cycle and DNA-damage checkpoint gene 
      hus1. In addition Lig1 is homologous to proteins of unknown function in Homo sapiens 
      (35% identity) and Mus musculus (31% identity). Induction of lig1 expression was 
      found to be controlled downstream from the point of integration of the 
      phytochrome-activated pathway and the pathway sensing the metabolic state, but 
      upstream of the developmental switch. The lig1 expression level in individual 
      plasmodia correlated positively with the probability to sporulate. Sensory control 
      of the lig1 expression level and its association with the developmental switch 
      suggests a possible mechanism for the coordination of differentiation and the 
      control of cell-cycle progression during the sporulation of P. polycephalum.

AB  - The article reviews the unique aspects of preparation and performance of cell 
      biology experiments flown on robotic space vehicles Bion and Foton, and gives an 
      overview of key findings in researches made under the author's leadership over the 
      past decades. Described are the criteria of selecting test objects, and the 
      conditions required for preparation and implementation of space and control 
      (synchronous) experiments. The present-day status and issues of researches into cell 
      responsivity to space microgravity and other factors are discussed. Also, 
      potentialities of equipment designed to conduct experiments with cell cultures in 
      vitro and populations of single-celled organisms are presented, as well as some 
      ideas for new devices and systems. Unveiled are some circumstances inherent to the 
      development and performance of space experiments, setting up laboratory facilities 
      at the launch and landing site, and methods of safe transportation and storage of 
      biosamples. In conclusion, the author puts forward his view on biospecies, equipment 
      and areas of research aboard future space vehicles.

TI  - Assembly into chromatin and subtype-specific transcriptional effects of exogenous 
      linker histones directly introduced into a living Physarum cell.
PG  - 965-73
AB  - The apparent diversity of linker histone subtypes may be related to their specific 
      roles in defining functional states of chromatin in vivo. We have developed a novel 
      method to study constitutive peptides throughout the cell cycle and have 
      demonstrated that an exogenous linker histone could be introduced into a living cell 
      of the slime mold Physarum polycephalum. Here, we have used this method to assess 
      the functional differences between three somatic linker histone subtypes in vivo, 
      and to demonstrate the general applicability of this method. Exogenous linker 
      histone proteins H1 degrees, H5 and H1 were directly absorbed into living cell 
      segments of the naturally synchronous Physarum macroplasmodia at precise cell cycle 
      stages. Fluorescence microscopy, native nucleoprotein gels and immunoblotting of 
      nuclei and chromatin with subtype-specific antibodies revealed that exogenous linker 
      histones were efficiently transported into nuclei and were integrated into 
      chromatin. The immunoreactivity of a preparation of anti-H1 degrees antibodies that 
      are blocked from binding to specific H1 degrees epitopes in native chromatin 
      indicates that the exogenous linker histones were similarly associated into Physarum 
      chromatin. Interestingly, linker histones were found to be less stably associated 
      with Physarum chromatin during S-phase than during G(2)-phase. Furthermore, we show 
      that exogenous linker histones incorporated in early G(2)-phase inhibited 
      transcription and that the level of inhibition correlates with the apparent role of 
      the linker histone subtype in regulating transcription in cells where it normally 
      occurs.

AB  - Detrimental effects of weigntlessness are no longer expected to hinder successful 
      mitosis. Experiments in space and on the fast clinostat give no hints of this. 
      Nevertheless we are thinking of a g sensitivity during the process of chromosome 
      condensation and distribution. The time course of nuclear division in microplasmodia 
      of the slime mold Physarum polycephalum was investigated under 0 g simulation on the 
      fast rotating clinostat in comparison to 1 g controls. The result of this experiment 
      is: A significant shortening of mitosis under 0 g simulation compared to 1 g 
      controls.

TI  - Ca2+-loaded spherulin 3a from Physarum polycephalum adopts the prototype 
      gamma-crystallin fold in aqueous solution.
PG  - 645-55
AB  - Spherulin 3a is the most abundantly expressed cytosolic protein in spherulating 
      plasmodia of the slime mold Physarum polycephalum. High yields of unlabeled, 
      uniformly 15N and uniformly 13C/15N-labeled recombinant spherulin 3a from 
      Escherichia coli could be produced by a simple protocol described here. The 
      three-dimensional solution structure of Ca2+-loaded spherulin 3a was determined by 
      homo- and heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. The structure of monomeric spherulin 3a 
      consists of two pleated beta-sheets plus a short alpha-helix arranged into the 
      gamma-crystallin fold. The beta-sheets comprise two intertwined Greek-key motifs. An 
      additional N-terminal beta-strand is unique to spherulin 3a. Complexation of calcium 
      ions greatly enhances overall conformational stability of the protein. The average 
      atomic root-mean-square deviations (r.m.s.d.) for heavy atoms in beta-strands were 
      0.34(+/-0.16) A for the backbone atoms and 0.73(+/-0.40) A for all atoms. The 
      corresponding r.m.s.d. values for heavy atoms in the whole protein were 
      0.62(+/-0.42) A for the backbone atoms and 0.99(+/-0.65) A for all atoms. We show 
      the structural relationship between spherulin 3a, a myxomycete dormancy protein, and 
      crystallins from the vertebrate eye lens. Since spherulin 3a has a structure 
      corresponding to one domain of bovine gammaB(II)-crystallin, it represents a 
      hypothetical ancestral gamma-crystallin precursor structure.

TI  - [Immunocytochemical identification of tropomyosin in nucleoli and nucleolar matrix 
      of Physarum polycephalum].
PG  - 402-7
AB  - Nucleoli were isolated from physarum polycephalum, and nucleolar matrix was prepared 
      by digesting the nucleoli respectively with DNase 1, 0.25 mol/L (NH4)2SO4 and 2 
      mol/L NaCl to remove DNA and most proteins. SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that there 
      were about 20 polypeptides in nucleolar matrix component, including the 37 kD 
      polypeptide which was similar to tropomyosin in molecular weight. The result of 
      indirect immunofluorescence treated with anti-tropomyosin antibody and sheep 
      anti-rabbit IgG antibody labelled with FITC showed that bright fluorescence was 
      observed in the nucleoli and nucleolar matrix, but no bright fluorescence in the 
      controls. Indirect Immunoblotting detection further verified that tropomyosin 
      existed in nucleolar matrix. Protein A-colloidal gold immunoelectron microscopic 
      study showed that there were many gold particles in the specimens labelled with 
      tropomyosin antibody, and there were few gold particles found in the controls. 
      Tropomyosin distributed dispersedly in nucleoli.

TI  - Isolation and partial characterization of haemagglutinins from plasmodia of Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 619-25
AB  - The soluble haemagglutinins produced by plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum were 
      purified by chromatographic methods and resolved into haemagglutinins I and II. On 
      SDS-PAGE, purified haemagglutinins I and II each gave a single band with an apparent 
      molecular mass of 6 and 11 kDa, respectively. The results of gel-filtration 
      chromatography suggested that both haemagglutinins were dimers of the respective 
      subunits under non-denaturing conditions. Rabbit erythrocytes were preferentially 
      agglutinated by both haemagglutinins. The human type A, B and O erythrocytes were 
      agglutinated by haemagglutinin II to an equal degree but were not agglutinated by 
      haemagglutinin I. Simple sugars failed to inhibit the activities of both 
      haemagglutinins. The activities, however, were effectively inhibited by the addition 
      of thyroglobulin. Other glycoproteins such as fetuin, orsomucoid and transferrin 
      inhibited the activity of haemagglutinin I but not that of haemagglutinin II. These 
      haemagglutinins were detected in a slime fraction obtained from the culture media of 
      starved plasmodia, suggesting that they are released to the outside of the 
      plasmalemma to become associated with the slime layer on the plasmodial surface.

TI  - Model for codon position bias in RNA editing.
PG  - 088101
AB  - RNA editing can be crucial for the expression of genetic information via inserting, 
      deleting, or substituting a few nucleotides at specific positions in an RNA 
      sequence. Within coding regions in an RNA sequence, editing usually occurs with a 
      certain bias in choosing the positions of the editing sites. In the mitochondrial 
      genes of Physarum polycephalum, many more editing events have been observed at the 
      third codon position than at the first and second, while in some plant mitochondria 
      the second codon position dominates. Here we propose an evolutionary model that 
      explains this bias as the basis of selection at the protein level. The model 
      predicts a distribution of the three positions rather close to the experimental 
      observation in Physarum. This suggests that the codon position bias in Physarum is 
      mainly a consequence of selection at the protein level.

TI  - Genome annotation in the presence of insertional RNA editing.
PG  - 2571-8
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btn487 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Insertional RNA editing renders gene prediction very difficult compared 
      to organisms without such RNA editing. A case in point is the mitochondrial genome 
      of Physarum polycephalum in which only about one-third of the number of genes that 
      are to be expected given its length are annotated. Thus, gene prediction methods 
      that explicitly take into account insertional editing are needed for successful 
      annotation of such genomes. RESULTS: We annotate the mitochondrial genome of 
      P.polycephalum using several different approaches for gene prediction in organisms 
      with insertional RNA editing. We computationally validate our annotations by 
      comparing the results from different methods against each other and as proof of 
      concept experimentally validate two of the newly predicted genes. We more than 
      double the number of annotated putative genes in this organism and find several 
      intriguing candidate genes that are not expected in a mitochondrial genome. 
      AVAILABILITY: The C source code of the programs described here are available upon 
      request from the corresponding author.

AB  - The influence of different concentrations of detergent Joy on the chromatin 
      structure of Physarum polycephalum in the process of mitotic cycle was studied 
      electronmicroscopically. The investigations showed that at Joy concentrations less 
      than 0,01% a small part of nuclei disrupt and, as a rule, chromatin is 
      insufficiently dispersed; at concentrations more than 0,1% the detergent may 
      influence the chromatin structure of Physarum polycephalum. Based on the data 
      obtained we consider that the optimal detergent concentrations that practically do 
      not influence the chromatin structure and lead to disruption of the majority of 
      nuclei and to the proper dispersion of chromatin is 0,1-0,01%.

TI  - Mapping of a Physarum chromosomal origin of replication tightly linked to a 
      developmentally-regulated profilin gene.
PG  - 3309-15
AB  - We compared the pattern of replication of two cell-type specific profilin genes in 
      one developmental stage of the slime mold Physarum polycephalum. Taking advantage of 
      the natural synchrony of S-phase within the plasmodium, we established that the 
      actively transcribed profilin P gene is tightly linked to a chromosomal replication 
      origin and is replicated at the onset of S-phase. In contrast, the inactive profilin 
      A gene is not associated with a replication origin and it is duplicated in mid 
      S-phase. Mapping by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis defines a short DNA fragment 
      in the proximal upstream region of the profilin P gene from which bidirectional 
      replication is initiated. We further provide an estimate of the kinetics of 
      elongation of the replicon and demonstrate that the 2 alleles of the profilin P gene 
      are coordinately replicated. All these results were obtained on total DNA 
      preparations extracted from untreated cells. They provide a strong evidence for site 
      specific initiation of DNA replication in Physarum.

TI  - Purification of an ATP-dependent actin-binding protein from a lower eukaryote, 
      Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 347-52
AB  - A novel protein with a molecular mass of 55 kDa, as determined by SDS-PAGE, was 
      purified from plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum. The protein bound to actin 
      filaments with a stoichiometry of 0.27 moles per mole of actin with an apparent 
      dissociation constant of 4 x 10(-8) M. In the presence of ATP, the protein 
      dissociated from actin filaments. Adenosine 5-(gamma-thio)triphosphate and 
      adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate also abolished the actin-binding activity of the 
      protein, but GTP did not. Because the cytoplasmic concentration of ATP oscillates in 
      association with the shuttle streaming of the cytoplasm, it is possible that this 
      protein might be involved in the actin-linked regulation of cytoplasmic streaming.

AB  - Specific antibodies against the histone H2A from calf thymus were generated by 
      injecting rabbits with complexes: histone H2A-RNA with a protein to RNA ratio of 
      3:1. In the microcomplement fixation assay the antibodies against the histone H2A 
      from calf thymus immuno-reacted with the histone H2A from calf thymus but not with 
      H2A from Physarum polycephalum. The histone H2A from calf thymus therefore appears 
      to have an immunological determinant(s) which does not exist in H2A from Physarum 
      polycephalum.

TI  - Mechanisms of cell shape change: the cytomechanics of cellular response to chemical 
      environment and mechanical loading.
PG  - 83-93
AB  - Processes such as cell locomotion and morphogenesis depend on both the generation of 
      force by cytoskeletal elements and the response of the cell to the resulting 
      mechanical loads. Many widely accepted theoretical models of processes involving 
      cell shape change are based on untested hypotheses about the interaction of these 
      two components of cell shape change. I have quantified the mechanical responses of 
      cytoplasm to various chemical environments and mechanical loading regimes to 
      understand better the mechanisms of cell shape change and to address the validity of 
      these models. Measurements of cell mechanical properties were made with strands of 
      cytoplasm submerged in media containing detergent to permeabilize the plasma 
      membrane, thus allowing control over intracellular milieu. Experiments were 
      performed with equipment that generated sinusoidally varying length changes of 
      isolated strands of cytoplasm from Physarum polycephalum. Results indicate that 
      stiffness, elasticity, and viscosity of cytoplasm all increase with increasing 
      concentration of Ca2+, Mg2+, and ATP, and decrease with increasing magnitude and 
      rate of deformation. These results specifically challenge assumptions underlying 
      mathematical models of morphogenetic events such as epithelial folding and cell 
      division, and further suggest that gelation may depend on both actin cross-linking 
      and actin polymerization.

TI  - Identification and sequence analysis of a rap gene from the true slime mold Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 29-33
AB  - A member of the ras gene superfamily, belonging to the rap family and designated 
      Pprap1, was isolated from a cDNA library from the true slime mold Physarum 
      polycephalum by plaque hybridization in combination with 5'-RACE. The assembled 
      nucleotide sequence of Pprap1 (1062 bp) has an open reading frame coding for a 
      protein of 188 amino acids of a calculated M(r) of 21035. This protein exhibits: (i) 
      a highly conserved GTP binding domain containing a putative effector domain, with 
      the threonine-for-glutamine substitution characteristic of rap proteins, (ii) a 
      hypervariable domain, and (iii) the CAAX motif. Analysis of the C-terminal amino 
      acid sequence of Pprap1 shows that it presumably undergoes geranylgeranylation but 
      is not palmitoylated; however, it contains a lysine-rich domain which might serve as 
      the second membrane localization signal. Pprap1 exhibits significantly high amino 
      acid homology within the GTP binding domain with its homologues: Ddrap1 from 
      Dictyostelium discoideum (92%) and human Rap1A (83%), and relatively low homology 
      (59%) with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologue, RSR1. It has also 59% and 61% 
      homology with the P. polycephalum Ppras1 and Ppras2 proteins, respectively. This 
      gene is the third member of the ras gene superfamily identified in P. polycephalum 
      so far.

TI  - Reduction of UV-induced mitotic delay by caffeine in BUdR-substituted plasmodia of 
      Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 101-5
AB  - Chromosomal DNA of the synchronously mitotic plasmodia of P. polycephalum was 
      substituted with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine, by growing the plasmodia during S phase, 
      on a medium containing this nucleoside analog. A strong synergism was observed 
      between bromodeoxyuridine and UV-irradiation, in late G2-irradiated plasmodia in 
      that, the mitotic delay obtained in them was much more than a simple sum of the 
      delays induced by these two agents individually. It was also observed that the 
      mitotic delay in this system is reduced significantly by different concentrations of 
      caffeine applied immediately after irradiation and there was a stage specificity in 
      this effect. The reduction in mitotic delay was maximum (80%) in those plasmodia 
      irradiated 20-30 min before control metaphase, when mitogenic factors also reach 
      their maximum activity in this system. It is proposed that the mitotic delay 
      reducing effect of caffeine is due to its ability to promote the activity of the 
      mitogenic factors, largely independent of the system which is responsible for 
      monitoring the state of the chromosomal DNA.

TI  - Mitochondrial DNA rearrangements associated with mF plasmid integration and 
      plasmodial longevity in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 178-87
AB  - Plasmodial cultures of Physarum polycephalum have defined life spans and undergo a 
      reproducible decline (senescence) before losing the ability to be subcultured. 
      Studies of the mtDNA of a long-lived Physarum strain, which does not undergo 
      senescence, revealed a 7. 9-kb insertion in its mtDNA. This insertion is derived 
      from a mitochondrial plasmid which enhances mitochondrial fusion and mtDNA 
      recombination. Four different recombination events are required to convert the 
      parental mtDNA to the form found in the long-lived strain. An additional 
      recombination event, which deletes a 2.4-kb region of the insert from the long-lived 
      strain, has been identified in the mtDNA of a normally senescing strain. These 
      observations imply a mitochondrial involvement in the process of plasmodial 
      senescence and implicate a region of the DNA derived from the mitochondrial plasmid 
      as being necessary for plasmodial longevity.

TI  - A non-cycling mitotic cyclin in the naturally synchronous cell cycle of Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 94-102
AB  - A universal model of the control of the cell cycle in eukaryotic organisms has 
      emerged from the discovery that MPF (maturation or mitosis promoting factor) is a 
      heterodimer consisting of a catalytic subunit (p34cdc2) and a regulatory subunit 
      (mitotic cyclin) encoded by a pair of conserved genes. A prominent feature of the 
      periodic activation of the protein kinase p34cdc2 is the gradual accumulation of 
      cyclin in interphase and its abrupt degradation in mitosis, which is believed to be 
      required for inactivation of MPF and exit from mitosis. Utilizing the precise 
      natural synchrony of mitosis of the plasmodium of the myxomycete Physarum, the high 
      affinity of the p34cdc2/cyclin B complex to p13suc1 Sepharose beads, and 
      immunological reagents including three different anticyclin B antibodies and the 
      anti-PSTAIR antibody, a transient histone H1 kinase activation but not fluctuation 
      in the abundance of cyclin B have been detected during mitosis. It is argued that 
      cyclin degradation may be required for cytokinesis and/or postmitotic controls of 
      cell proliferation in G1 phase and cell-to-cell signaling in development but not for 
      the inactivation of histone H1 kinase in mitosis.

      polycephalum.
PG  - 82-6
AB  - DEAE-Sepharose chromatography of extracts from plasmodia of the myxomycete Physarum 
      polycephalum revealed the presence of multiple histone acetyltransferases and 
      histone deacetylases. A cytoplasmic histone acetyltransferase B, specific for 
      histone H4, and two nuclear acetyltransferases A1 and A2 were identified; A1 
      acetylates all core histones with a preference for H3 and H2A, whereas A2 is 
      specific for H3 and also slightly for H2B. Two histone deacetylases, HD1 and HD2, 
      could be discriminated. They differ with respect to substrate specificity and pH 
      dependence. For the first time the substrate specificity of histone deacetylases was 
      determined using HPLC-purified individual core histone species. The order of 
      acetylated substrate preference is H2A much greater than H3 greater than or equal to 
      H4 greater than H2B for HD1 and H3 greater than H2A greater than H4 for HD2, 
      respectively; HD2 is inactive with H2B as substrate. Moreover histone deacetylases 
      are very sensitive to butyrate, since 2 mM butyrate leads to more than 50% 
      inhibition of enzyme activity.

AB  - In this paper, we report the dose-dependent antioxidant activity and DNA protective 
      effects of zingerone. At 500 μg/mL, the DPPH radical scavenging activity of 
      zingerone and ascorbic acid as a standard was found to be 86.7 and 94.2 % 
      respectively. At the same concentration, zingerone also showed significant reducing 
      power (absorbance 0.471) compared to that of ascorbic acid (absorbance 0.394). The 
      in vitro toxicity of stannous chloride (SnCl2) was evaluated using genomic and 
      plasmid DNA. SnCl2-induced degradation of genomic DNA was found to occur at a 
      concentration of 0.8 mM onwards with complete degradation at 1.02 mM and above. In 
      the case of plasmid DNA, conversion of supercoiled DNA into the open circular form 
      indicative of DNA nicking activity was observed at a concentration of 0.2 mM 
      onwards; complete conversion was observed at a concentration of 1.02 mM and above. 
      Zingerone was found to confer protection against SnCl2-induced oxidative damage to 
      genomic and plasmid DNA at concentrations of 500 and 750 μg/mL onwards, 
      respectively. This protective effect was further confirmed in the presence of 
      UV/H2O2-a known reactive oxygen species (ROS) generating system-wherein protection 
      by zingerone against ROS-mediated DNA damage was observed at a concentration of 
      250 μg/mL onwards in a dose-dependent manner. This study clearly indicated the in 
      vitro DNA protective property of zingerone against SnCl2-induced, ROS-mediated DNA 
      damage.

TI  - Intrinsically bent DNA flanks both sides of an RNA polymerase I transcription start 
      site. Both regions display novel electrophoretic mobility.
PG  - 9958-64
AB  - We have identified two intrinsically bent regions of DNA which flank the 
      transcription start site of the rRNA gene from Physarum polycephalum. DNA fragments 
      from both regions were analyzed by circular permutation polyacrylamide gel 
      electrophoresis assay and computer modeling. Both types of analysis indicate that 
      one fragment contains a relatively simple bend centered about 160 base pairs (bp) 
      upstream of the transcription start site while the other fragment contains multiple 
      bends, the most prominent of which is centered about 150 bp downstream of the start 
      site. According to both gel mobilities and computer modeling we estimate that the 
      net bending in each is about 45 degrees. These fragments were studied in detail by 
      varying parameters of electrophoresis that are known to affect bending. Previous 
      work indicates that anomalous mobility should decrease when temperature or ethidium 
      bromide concentration is increased, whereas anomalous mobility should increase when 
      polyacrylamide gel percentage is increased. The anomalous mobility of both fragments 
      decreases as temperature is raised from 4 to 65 degrees C, although the bent 
      structure centered at -160 bp is more temperature labile than the bend at +150 bp. 
      Strikingly different behavior was observed for the two fragments as the 
      polyacrylamide concentrations was varied. As polyacrylamide concentrations are 
      increased from 6 to 10%, the anomalous mobility of the bend centered at -160 bp 
      increases while that of the bend centered at +150 bp decreases. The bend centered at 
      +150 bp is "straightened" at all ethidium concentrations tested. In sharp contrast 
      and unexpectedly, the anomalous migration of the bend centered at -160 bp increases 
      dramatically in 0.1 micrograms/ml ethidium bromide. Many of the mobility differences 
      we observe suggest that the two regions studied represent structurally distinct 
      forms of bent DNA. The location of these strongly bent regions on either side of a 
      RNA polymerase I transcription start site suggests important roles for such 
      structures in chromatin structure and transcription initiation.

PG  - 524-8
AB  - The free-living haploid gametes of the Myxomycete Physarum polycephalum are 
      biflagellate phagocytic cells displaying gross morphological and biochemical 
      differences as compared to the diploid plasmodium. The residual acidic chromatin and 
      nucleolar proteins from gametes compatible for mating-type allele have been examined 
      and compared to identical fractions from the diploid plasmodium. The proteins from 
      both gamete mating types are identical yet major differences in the complement of 
      these proteins occur following karyogamy and plasmodial formation. These differences 
      occur in a fraction of acidic chromatin proteins previously shown to contain 
      polypeptides which undergo dramatic changes during differentiation of the diploid 
      plasmodium.

TI  - Inhibitory Ca(2+)-regulation of myosin light chain kinase in the lower eukaryote, 
      Physarum polycephalum: role of a Ca(2+)-dependent inhibitory factor.
PG  - 113-22
AB  - ATP-dependent interactions between myosin and actin in the lower eukaryote, Physarum 
      polycephalum, are inhibited by micromolar levels of Ca2+. This inhibition is 
      mediated by the binding of Ca2+ to myosin, the phosphorylation of which is required 
      if Ca2+ is to inhibit the activities of myosin (Kohama, K., Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 
      11, 433-435 (1990)). As the first step to examine whether Ca2+ also regulates 
      phosphorylation in the actomyosin system, we purified myosin light chain kinase 
      (MLCK) of 55 kDa almost to homogeneity. The MLCK activity was high whether or not 
      Ca2+ was present. However, a Ca(2+)-dependent inhibitory factor (CIF) purified from 
      Physarum (Okagaki et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 176, 564-570 (1991)) was 
      shown to reduce the MLCK activity in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. Using crude 
      preparations, not only MLCK but also myosin heavy chain kinase and actin kinase were 
      shown to be inhibited by Ca2+ half-maximally at micromolar levels. Since CIF is the 
      only Ca(2+)-binding protein in the preparations, we propose that this inhibitory 
      Ca(2+)-regulation of the kinases for actomyosin is mediated by CIF.

AB  - The mechanism of stimulation of DNA synthesis by microtubule-associated protein 2 
      (MAP2) was examined in the nuclear matrix isolated from Physarum polycephalum. 
      Porcine brain MAP2 stimulated DNA synthesis by the matrix with exogenous templates, 
      but not with endogenous templates. Kinetic analyses showed that MAP2 decreases the 
      Km of the matrix for deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. Comparison of the Km values 
      of active- and latent-type DNA replication machineries of Physarum suggested a 
      possible role for MAPs or MAP-like proteins in DNA replication.

TI  - Crystal structure of the calcium-loaded spherulin 3a dimer sheds light on the 
      evolution of the eye lens betagamma-crystallin domain fold.
PG  - 115-24
AB  - BACKGROUND: The betagamma-crystallins belong to a superfamily of two-domain proteins 
      found in vertebrate eye lenses, with distant relatives occurring in microorganisms. 
      It has been considered that an eukaryotic stress protein, spherulin 3a, from the 
      slime mold Physarum polycephalum shares a common one-domain ancestor with 
      crystallins, similar to the one-domain 3-D structure determined by NMR. RESULTS: The 
      X-ray structure of spherulin 3a shows it to be a tight homodimer, which is 
      consistent with ultracentrifugation studies. The (two-motif) domain fold contains a 
      pair of calcium binding sites very similar to those found in a two-domain 
      prokaryotic betagamma-crystallin fold family member, Protein S. Domain pairing in 
      the spherulin 3a dimer is two-fold symmetric, but quite different in character from 
      the pseudo-two-fold pairing of domains in betagamma-crystallins. There is no 
      evidence that the spherulin 3a single domain can fold independently of its partner 
      domain, a feature that may be related to the absence of a tyrosine corner. 
      CONCLUSION: Although it is accepted that the vertebrate two-domain 
      betagamma-crystallins evolved from a common one-domain ancestor, the mycetezoan 
      single-domain spherulin 3a, with its unique mode of domain pairing, is likely to be 
      an evolutionary offshoot, perhaps from as far back as the one-motif ancestral stage. 
      The spherulin 3a protomer stability appears to be dependent on domain pairing. 
      Spherulin-like domain sequences that are found within bacterial proteins associated 
      with virulence are likely to bind calcium.

TI  - Purification and partial amino acid sequence of the actin-fragmin kinase from 
      Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 111-9
AB  - The 80-kDa actin-fragmin kinase (AFK) was purified from Physarum polycephalum 
      microplasmodia to apparent homogeneity through a procedure involving six 
      chromatographic steps. Taking the activity at the first purification step as 100%, 
      the kinase was purified more than 1500-fold, with an overall yield of 8%. The 
      specific activity of the purified enzyme was 700 U/mg. The total amount of AFK 
      present could be estimated as 34 ng/mg extracted protein. One of the polyclonal 
      antibodies raised against four tryptic peptides of the purified 80-kDa AFK 
      recognized the 80-kDa band in an immunoblot and could inhibit the AFK activity up to 
      100%. A minor 78-kDa protein, also displaying AFK activity, appeared to be derived 
      from the 80-kDa AFK. A partial amino acid sequence analysis, covering up to 20% of 
      the protein (150 amino acids), was performed and confirmed the lack of similarity 
      with any of the sequenced kinases. These data are in agreement with the unique 
      physical and enzymatic properties of the AFK.

LID - 10.1002/mabi.200700249 [doi]
AB  - The preparation of nanoparticles from 75% methylated poly(beta-L-malic acid) is 
      described. Their degradation in aqueous environments was examined and the influence 
      of pH and lipase on the rate of hydrolysis was evaluated. Six proteins were used to 
      estimate the loading efficiency of the nanoparticles. The amount of protein retained 
      in the nanoparticles was found to depend on the acid/basic character of the protein. 
      Protein release from the loaded nanoparticles upon incubation in water under 
      physiological conditions encompassed polymer hydrolysis and happened steadily within 
      3-10 d. The activity loss of entrapped alpha-chymotrypsin caused by loading and 
      releasing depended on the method used for loading.

TI  - Functional alpha-fragment of beta-galactosidase can be expressed from the mobile 
      group I intron PpLSU3 embedded in yeast pre-ribosomal RNA derived from the 
      chromosomal rDNA locus.
PG  - 1428-38
AB  - PpLSU3, a mobile group I intron found in the ribo-somal RNA genes of Physarum 
      polycephalum, encodes the I-PpoI homing endonuclease. This enzyme represents one of 
      the rare cases in nature where a protein is expressed from an RNA polymerase I 
      transcript. Our previous results showed that the full length intron, but not a 
      further processed species, is the messenger for I-PpoI, implying a role of the 
      untranslated region (UTR) in gene expression. To study the function of the 3'-UTR in 
      expression of the endonuclease and in splicing of the intron, we replaced the I-PpoI 
      gene in PpLSU3 with the gene for the alpha-fragment of Escherichia coli 
      beta-galactosidase, and then integrated this chimeric intron into all the 
      chromosomal rDNA repeats of yeast. The resulting cells synthesized functional 
      alpha-fragment, as evidenced by a complementation assay analogous to that used in 
      E.coli. The beta-galactosidase activity thus provides an unusual and potentially 
      valuable readout for Pol I transcription from chromosomal rDNA. This is the first 
      example in which a eucaryotic homing endonuclease gene has been successfully 
      replaced by a heterologous gene. Using deletion mutagenesis and a novel 
      randomization approach with the alpha-fragment as a reporter, we found that a small 
      segment of the 3'-UTR dramatically influences both splicing and protein expression.

TI  - True-slime-mould-inspired hydrostatically coupled oscillator system exhibiting 
      versatile behaviours.
PG  - 035001
AB  - Behavioural diversity is an indispensable attribute of living systems, which makes 
      them intrinsically adaptive and responsive to the demands of a dynamically changing 
      environment. In contrast, conventional engineering approaches struggle to suppress 
      behavioural diversity in artificial systems to reach optimal performance in given 
      environments for desired tasks. The goals of this research include understanding the 
      essential mechanism that endows living systems with behavioural diversity and 
      implementing the mechanism in robots to exhibit adaptive behaviours. For this 
      purpose, we have focused on an amoeba-like unicellular organism: the plasmodium of 
      true slime mould. Despite the absence of a central nervous system, the plasmodium 
      exhibits versatile spatiotemporal oscillatory patterns and switches spontaneously 
      among these patterns. By exploiting this behavioural diversity, it is able to 
      exhibit adaptive behaviour according to the situation encountered. Inspired by this 
      organism, we built a real physical robot using hydrostatically coupled oscillators 
      that produce versatile oscillatory patterns and spontaneous transitions among the 
      patterns. The experimental results show that exploiting physical hydrostatic 
      interplay—the physical dynamics of the robot—allows simple phase oscillators to 
      promote versatile behaviours. The results can contribute to an understanding of how 
      a living system generates versatile and adaptive behaviours with physical interplays 
      among body parts.

TI  - Platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolases: broad substrate specificity and 
      lipoprotein binding does not modulate the catalytic properties of the plasma enzyme.
PG  - 4539-49
AB  - Platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolases (PAF-AHs) are a group of enzymes that 
      hydrolyze the sn-2 acetyl ester of PAF (phospholipase A(2) activity) but not 
      phospholipids with two long fatty acyl groups. Our previous studies showed that 
      membrane-bound human plasma PAF-AH (pPAF-AH) accesses its substrate only from the 
      aqueous phase, which raises the possibility that this enzyme can hydrolyze a variety 
      of lipid esters that are partially soluble in the aqueous phase. Here we show that 
      pPAF-AH has broad substrate specificity in that it hydrolyzes short-chain 
      diacylglycerols, triacylglycerols, and acetylated alkanols, and displays 
      phospholipase A(1) activity. On the basis of all of the substrate specificity 
      results, it appears that the minimal structural requirement for a good pPAF-AH 
      substrate is the portion of a glyceride derivative that includes an sn-2 ester and a 
      reasonably hydrophobic chain in the position occupied by the sn-1 chain. In vivo, 
      pPAF-AH is bound to high and low density lipoproteins, and we show that the apparent 
      maximal velocity for this enzyme is not influenced by lipoprotein binding and that 
      the enzyme hydrolyzes tributyroylglycerol as well as the recombinant pPAF-AH does. 
      Broad substrate specificity is also observed for the structurally homologous PAF-AH 
      which occurs intracellularly [PAF-AH(II)] as well as for the PAF-AH from the lower 
      eukaryote Physarum polycephalum although pPAF-AH and PAF-AH(II) tolerate the removal 
      of the sn-3 headgroup better than the PAF-AH from P. polycephalum does. In contrast, 
      the intracellular PAF-AH found in mammalian brain [PAF-AH(Ib) alpha 1/alpha 1 and 
      alpha 2/alpha 2 homodimers] is more selectively operative on compounds with a short 
      acetyl chain although this enzyme also displays significant phospholipase A(1) 
      activity.

TI  - Fully decentralized control of a soft-bodied robot inspired by true slime mold.
PG  - 261-9
LID - 10.1007/s00422-010-0367-9 [doi]
AB  - Animals exhibit astoundingly adaptive and supple locomotion under real world 
      constraints. In order to endow robots with similar capabilities, we must implement 
      many degrees of freedom, equivalent to animals, into the robots' bodies. For taming 
      many degrees of freedom, the concept of autonomous decentralized control plays a 
      pivotal role. However a systematic way of designing such autonomous decentralized 
      control system is still missing. Aiming at understanding the principles that 
      underlie animals' locomotion, we have focused on a true slime mold, a primitive 
      living organism, and extracted a design scheme for autonomous decentralized control 
      system. In order to validate this design scheme, this article presents a soft-bodied 
      amoeboid robot inspired by the true slime mold. Significant features of this robot 
      are twofold: (1) the robot has a truly soft and deformable body stemming from 
      real-time tunable springs and protoplasm, the former is used for an outer skin of 
      the body and the latter is to satisfy the law of conservation of mass; and (2) fully 
      decentralized control using coupled oscillators with completely local sensory 
      feedback mechanism is realized by exploiting the long-distance physical interaction 
      between the body parts stemming from the law of conservation of protoplasmic mass. 
      Simulation results show that this robot exhibits highly supple and adaptive 
      locomotion without relying on any hierarchical structure. The results obtained are 
      expected to shed new light on design methodology for autonomous decentralized 
      control system.

TI  - Class-specific binding of two aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases to annexin, a Ca2+- and 
      phospholipid-binding protein.
PG  - 159-64
AB  - Annexins are a family of Ca2+/phospholipid-binding proteins that have diverse 
      functions. To understand the function of annexin in Physarum polycephalum, we 
      searched for its binding proteins. Here we demonstrate the presence of two novel 
      annexin-binding proteins. The homology search of partial amino acid sequences of 
      these two proteins identified them as aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs). 
      Furthermore, antibody against aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases cross-reacted with one of 
      two proteins. Our results imply the interaction between intracellular membrane 
      dynamics and protein translation system, and may give a clue to understand the 
      mechanism of some myositis diseases, which have been known to produce autoantibodies 
      against ARSs.

TI  - [Chemotaxis as a method for testing of the biological effects of silver 
      nanoparticles].
PG  - 859-65
AB  - A method for assessing the abiotic efficiency of water-dispersed nano-sized silver 
      particles is suggested. Nanoparticles were obtained by the method of biochemical 
      synthesis in reversed micelles made from anionic surfactant bis-(2-ethylhexyl) 
      sodium sulfosuccinate (AOT). A water dispersion of nanoparticles was prepared from 
      the micellar solution in organic solvent by means of a special procedure. The 
      abiotic efficiency assay is based on the capacity of cells to respond by the 
      negative chemotaxis to chemical agents with harmful metabolic action. In plasmodium 
      of myxomicete Physarum polycephalum, the biocide and repellent effects of silver 
      nanoparticles, Ag+ ions, and AOT were tested in order to compare the abiotic 
      efficiency of these substances in water solution and after introduction into agar 
      substrate. The increase in the oscillation period, the reduction in the area of 
      spreading, and the avoidance reaction in the spatial test, taken together, revealed 
      a much higher repellent efficiency of silver nanoparticles as compared with that of 
      Ag+ ions and AOT. The NSP concentrations lethal for Physarum were similar to those 
      found earlier for bacteria and viruses. The chemotaxis-based tests applied in this 
      study allow one to quantitatively assess cell reactions and monitor their time 
      course. Besides, they have a much higher resolving capacity than the tests based on 
      lethal effects of abiotic substances.

AB  - Some physico-chemical properties of cyclic nucleotide-independent protein kinase 
      from the myxomycete Physarum polycephalum were studied. The enzyme is not activated 
      by Ca2+ and double-stranded RNA of poly(A)-poly(Y). The nature of the amino acid, 
      target for phosphorylation, for the homogenous enzyme was established by 
      two-dimensional electrophoresis, using casein as a protein substrate. The enzyme 
      exclusively phosphorylates threonine residues in the casein molecule.

PG  - 1083-90
AB  - The development of an amoeba into a plasmodium involves extensive changes in 
      cellular organisation and gene expression. The genetic basis of a number of 
      recessive mutations that block plasmodium development has been elucidated. The stage 
      at which development becomes abnormal has been determined for all the mutants, as 
      has the terminal phenotype. In order to investigate the changes in gene expression 
      that accompany plasmodium development, a cDNA library has been made using RNA 
      isolated from cell populations in which development was occurring.

TI  - Low rate of replication fork progression lengthens the replication timing of a locus 
      containing an early firing origin.
PG  - 5763-74
AB  - Invariance of temporal order of genome replication in eukaryotic cells and its 
      correlation with gene activity has been well-documented. However, recent data 
      suggest a relax control of replication timing. To evaluate replication schedule 
      accuracy, we detailed the replicational organization of the developmentally 
      regulated php locus that we previously found to be lately replicated, even though 
      php gene is highly transcribed in naturally synchronous plasmodia of Physarum. 
      Unexpectedly, bi-dimensional agarose gel electrophoreses of DNA samples prepared at 
      specific time points of S phase showed that replication of the locus actually begins 
      at the onset of S phase but it proceeds through the first half of S phase, so that 
      complete replication of php-containing DNA fragments occurs in late S phase. Origin 
      mapping located replication initiation upstream php coding region. This proximity 
      and rapid fork progression through the coding region result in an early replication 
      of php gene. We demonstrated that afterwards an unusually low fork rate and 
      unidirectional fork pausing prolong complete replication of php locus, and we 
      excluded random replication timing. Importantly, we evidenced that the origin linked 
      to php gene in plasmodium is not fired in amoebae when php expression dramatically 
      reduced, further illustrating replication-transcription coupling in Physarum.

AB  - A systematic method for an autonomous decentralized control system is still lacking, 
      despite its appealing concept. In order to alleviate this, we focused on the 
      amoeboid locomotion of the true slime mold, and extracted a design scheme for the 
      decentralized control mechanism that leads to adaptive behavior for the entire 
      system, based on the so-called discrepancy function. In this paper, we intensively 
      investigate the universality of this design scheme by applying it to a different 
      type of locomotion based on a 'synthetic approach'. As a first step, we implement 
      this design scheme to the control of a real physical two-dimensional serpentine 
      robot that exhibits slithering locomotion. The experimental results show that the 
      robot exhibits adaptive behavior and responds to the environmental changes; it is 
      also robust against malfunctions of the body segments due to the local sensory 
      feedback control that is based on the discrepancy function. We expect the results to 
      shed new light on the methodology of autonomous decentralized control systems.

TI  - Phytosterols are present in Pneumocystis carinii.
PG  - 2534-40
AB  - Although originally classified as a protozoan, Pneumocystis carinii is now 
      considered to have fungal characteristics. Drugs typically used for the treatment of 
      fungal infections target ergosterol. Because P. carinii is an important pathogen in 
      AIDS and other immunocompromised patients, knowledge of the sterol content of this 
      organism may be useful as a basis for developing new treatment strategies or for 
      improving diagnosis. P. carinii organisms were harvested from infected rat lungs and 
      were purified by filtration. Control preparations from uninfected animals were 
      identically prepared. Lipids were extracted from the organisms and control 
      preparations and were separated into neutral lipid, glycolipid, and phospholipid 
      fractions by silicic acid chromatography. The neutral lipid fraction was further 
      treated by alkaline hydrolysis and was analyzed by reversed-phase high-pressure 
      liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and GC-mass spectrometry 
      (GC-MS). As shown by HPLC, the neutral lipid fraction from infected rats contained a 
      minimum of six peaks, while in control preparations a single peak with a retention 
      time identical to that of cholesterol was observed. The predominant sterol in these 
      preparations was positively identified by GC-MS as cholesterol and constituted 80 to 
      90% of the total. The remaining peaks had relative retention times similar to those 
      of phytosterols by both HPLC and GC, and the similarity of these sterols to those 
      derived from plants and fungi was confirmed by MS. Ergosterol, however, was not 
      present. These results provide further evidence for a close phylogenetic 
      relationship between P. carinii and fungi and suggest that these sterols could be 
      used as targets for drug development and for improving diagnosis.

TI  - Synthetic substrates and inhibitors of beta-poly(L-malate)-hydrolase (polymalatase).
PG  - 5101-5
AB  - Polymalatase from Physarum polycephalum calalysed the hydrolysis of 
      beta-poly[L-malate] and of the synthetic compounds beta-di(L-malate), 
      beta-tetra(L-malate), beta-tetra(L-malate) beta-propylester, and L-malate 
      beta-methylester. Cyclic beta-tri(L-malate), cyclic beta-tetra(L-malate), and 
      D-malate beta-methylester were not cleaved, but were competitive inhibitors. The 
      O-terminal acetate of beta-tetra(L-malate) was neither a substrate nor an inhibitor. 
      L-Malate was liberated; the Km, Ki and Vmax values were measured. The appearance of 
      comparable amounts of beta-tri(L-malate), and beta-di(L-malate) during the cleavage 
      of beta-tetra(L-malate) indicated a distributive mechanism for small substrates. The 
      accumulation of a series of oligomers, peaking with the 11-mer and 12-mer in the 
      absence of higher intermediates, indicated that the depolymerization of 
      beta-poly(L-malate) was processive. The results indicate that beta-poly(L-malate) is 
      anchored at its OH-terminus by the highly specific binding of the penultimate malyl 
      residue. The malyl moieties beyond 12 residues downstream from the OH-terminus 
      extend into a diffuse second, electrostatic binding site. The catalytic site joins 
      the first binding site, accounting for the cleavage of the polymer into malate 
      residues. It is proposed that the enzyme does not dissociate from 
      beta-poly(L-malate) during hydrolysis, when both sites are filled with the polymer. 
      When only the first binding site is filled, the reaction partitions at each oligomer 
      between hydrolysis and dissociation.

TI  - Insertional editing in isolated Physarum mitochondria is linked to RNA synthesis.
PG  - 821-37
AB  - The mitochondrial RNAs of Physarum polycephalum are edited efficiently by nucleotide 
      insertion both in vivo and in isolated mitochondria. Our recent studies have 
      demonstrated that nucleotide addition can occur within 14-22 nt of the 3' end of a 
      nascent RNA, suggesting that insertional editing may be linked to transcription. To 
      investigate the relationship between these processes, we have examined the effects 
      of nucleotide concentration on templated and nontemplated nucleotide addition in 
      isolated mitochondria. At very low CTP concentrations, transcription and editing 
      proceed with high fidelity, but the efficiency of cytidine insertional editing 
      decreases. Insertion of single uridine and dinucleotides is not diminished under 
      conditions that yield unedited or partially edited C insertion sites, indicating 
      that editing events occur independently of one another. Moreover, analysis of 
      partially edited RNA demonstrates that single nucleotides can be added at 
      dinucleotide insertion sites. Importantly, pulse-chase experiments indicate that 
      nontemplated nucleotides are not inserted into previously synthesized RNA once 
      editing conditions are restored, although RNA downstream of the unedited region is 
      edited efficiently. This result indicates that insertional editing cannot occur 
      posttranscriptionally under these conditions, and suggests that there is only a 
      small "window of opportunity" in which nucleotide insertion can occur. Our data are 
      consistent with an editing activity that functions in a strictly 5' to 3' direction 
      and adds nucleotides at, or close to, the 3' end of nascent RNA in association with 
      the transcription complex. Several possible models for the mechanism of insertional 
      editing in Physarum are discussed.

TI  - Spontaneous switching of frequency-locking by periodic stimulus in oscillators of 
      plasmodium of the true slime mold.
PG  - 133-40
AB  - Microfabrication technique was used to construct a model system with a living cell 
      of plasmodium of the true slime mold, Physarum polycephalum, a living coupled 
      oscillator system. Its parameters can be systematically controlled as in computer 
      simulations, so that results are directly comparable to those of general 
      mathematical models. As the first step, we investigated responses in oscillatory 
      cells, the oscillators of the plasmodium, to periodic stimuli by temperature changes 
      to elucidate characteristics of the cells as nonlinear systems whose internal 
      dynamics are unknown because of their complexity. We observed that the forced 
      oscillator of the plasmodium show 1:1, 2:1, 3:1 frequency locking inside so-called 
      Arnold tongues regions as well as in other nonlinear systems such as chemical 
      systems and other biological systems. In addition, we found spontaneous switching 
      behavior from certain frequency locking states to other states, even under certain 
      fixed parameters. This technique can be applied to more complex systems with 
      multiple elements, such as coupled oscillator systems, and would be useful to 
      investigate complicated phenomena in biological systems such as information 
      processing.

TI  - Dry stress-induced phosphorylation of Physarum actin.
PG  - 653-8
AB  - Protein phosphorylation plays important roles in a variety of stress responses. 
      Although plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum rapidly grows and shows an active 
      cytoplasmic streaming under nutrient and wet conditions, dry stress transforms 
      plasmodium into a dormant state called sclerotium. Sclerotium can change into 
      plasmodium within several hours after addition of water. We herein report that more 
      than half of actin in sclerotium was in a phosphorylated state. The in vivo 
      phosphorylation site was identified to be Thr-203 which is in contact with another 
      actin molecule upon polymerization. The phosphorylated from of actin showed no 
      polymerizing activity, while the unphosphorylated form possessed the ability to 
      polymerize into F-actin. These results suggest that phosphorylation of Physarum 
      actin is involved in reorganization and/or preservation of the actin molecules in 
      the process of sclerotium formation.

TI  - Secretion of slime, the extracellular matrix of the plasmodium, as visualized with a 
      fluorescent probe and its correlation with locomotion on the substratum.
PG  - 279-89
AB  - Slime, the extracellular matrix of Physarum plasmodium, is secreted by the 
      exocytosis of a vesicles that contain a slime precursor. Using an antibody raised 
      against biochemically purified slime, we detected the intracellular localization of 
      the slime vesicle. Slime vesicles are abundant in the advancing front of the 
      plasmodium, as confirmed by electron microscopic observation in two different 
      cross-sectional angles. Screening various reagents, we found that 
      rhodamine-phosphatidylethanolamine (Rh-PE) binds specifically to slime in both its 
      intravesicular and extracellular forms, as confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy 
      using an antibody against fluorochrome rhodamine. The plasmodia vitally stained with 
      Rh-PE exhibited dynamic fluorescent patterns during the course of locomotion. The 
      fluorescence was conspicuous at the periphery of the leading pseudopods and 
      oscillated according to the shuttle streaming that accompanied the relaxation and 
      contraction of the periphery; it was intense in the relaxation phase when pseudopods 
      extended, and became weak in the contraction phase when pseudopods contracted. The 
      results collectively mean that the slime vesicles carried by the cytoplasmic 
      streaming accumulated prior to secretion at the advancing margin of the plasmodium.

TI  - Phylogenetic conservation of modified nucleotides in the terminal loop 1 of the 
      spliceosomal U5 snRNA.
PG  - 16-21
AB  - In order to study the phylogenetic conservation of modified nucleotides in the 
      spliceosomal U5 snRNA, we determined the nucleotide sequences of the U5 snRNAs from 
      the slime mold Physarum polycephalum (EMBL data bank accession numbers: X74440 and 
      X74441) and we identified the pseudouridine and 2'-O-methylated residues. From a 
      comparison of all the U5 snRNAs studied at the level of nucleotide modifications, we 
      concluded that the modified nucleotides in U5 snRNA can be divided into three 
      classes according to their degree of conservation: i) the modified nucleotides of 
      the 5' terminal cap structure that display some variations from one species to the 
      other; ii) the modified nucleotides located in the helical part of the stem/loop 
      structure I that vary greatly in number, position and identity from one species to 
      the other; and iii) the modified nucleotides of the terminal loop 1, that are almost 
      identical in all the species studied. Taking into account the recent discovery of a 
      crucial role played by this terminal loop of U5 snRNA in 5' and 3' splice site 
      definition, we postulate that the numerous modified nucleotides it contains, five 
      out of a total of 11, play an important role in spliceosome assembly and function. 
      Their possible role is discussed.

TI  - Unexpectedly complex editing patterns at dinucleotide insertion sites in Physarum 
      mitochondria.
PG  - 7821-8
AB  - Many of the RNAs transcribed from the mitochondrial genome of Physarum polycephalum 
      are edited by the insertion of nonencoded nucleotides, which are added either singly 
      or as dinucleotides. In addition, at least one mRNA is also subject to 
      substitutional editing in which encoded C residues are changed to U residues 
      posttranscriptionally. We have shown previously that the predominant type of editing 
      in these organelles, the insertion of nonencoded single C residues, occurs 
      cotranscriptionally at the growing end of the RNA chain. However, less is known 
      about the timing of dinucleotide addition, and it has been suggested that these 
      insertions occur at a later stage in RNA maturation. Here we examine the addition of 
      both single nucleotides and dinucleotides into nascent RNAs synthesized in vitro and 
      in vivo. The distribution of added nucleotides within individual cloned cDNAs 
      supports the hypothesis that all insertion sites are processed at the same time 
      relative to transcription. In addition, the patterns of partial editing and 
      misediting observed within these nascent RNAs suggest that separate factors may be 
      required at a subset of dinucleotide insertion sites and raise the possibility that 
      in vivo, nucleotides may be added to RNA and then changed posttranscriptionally.

TI  - Dispersion relation in oscillatory reaction-diffusion systems with self-consistent 
      flow in true slime mold.
PG  - 745-60
AB  - In the large amoeboid organism Physarum, biochemical oscillators are spatially 
      distributed throughout the organism and their collective motion exhibits phase 
      waves, which carry physiological signals. The basic nature of this wave behaviour is 
      not well-understood because, to date, an important effect has been neglected, 
      namely, the shuttle streaming of protoplasm which accompanies the biochemical 
      rhythms. Here we study the effects of self-consistent flow on the wave behaviour of 
      oscillatory reaction-diffusion models proposed for the Physarum plasmodium, by means 
      of numerical simulation for the dispersion relation and weakly nonlinear analysis 
      for derivation of the phase equation. We conclude that the flow term is able to 
      increase the speed of phase waves (similar to elongation of wave length). We compare 
      the theoretical consequences with real waves observed in the organism and also point 
      out the physiological roles of these effects on control mechanisms of intracellular 
      communication.

AB  - Identifying influential spreaders in networks, which contributes to optimizing the 
      use of available resources and efficient spreading of information, is of great 
      theoretical significance and practical value. A random-walk-based algorithm 
      LeaderRank has been shown as an effective and efficient method in recognizing 
      leaders in social network, which even outperforms the well-known PageRank method. As 
      LeaderRank is initially developed for binary directed networks, further extensions 
      should be studied in weighted networks. In this paper, a generalized algorithm 
      PhysarumSpreader is proposed by combining LeaderRank with a positive feedback 
      mechanism inspired from an amoeboid organism called Physarum Polycephalum. By taking 
      edge weights into consideration and adding the positive feedback mechanism, 
      PhysarumSpreader is applicable in both directed and undirected networks with 
      weights. By taking two real networks for examples, the effectiveness of the proposed 
      method is demonstrated by comparing with other standard centrality measures.

TI  - Structure and identity of a late-replicating and transcriptionally active gene.
PG  - 506-13
AB  - Eukaryotic genes are usually replicated early during S-phase in the cell lineages in 
      which they are expressed. Using partially characterized cDNA probes, we recently 
      established two exceptions to this rule in the slime mold Physarum polycephalum. In 
      this paper, we analyzed the structure and the identity of one of these two genes. By 
      genomic cloning and Southern analysis we demonstrate that it is a single-copy gene 
      and decipher the structure of the two alleles by taking advantage of a restriction 
      fragment length polymorphism. By cDNA cloning and sequencing, we deduced the amino 
      acid coding capacity of the mRNA. Finally, we confirmed the late replication of this 
      abundantly expressed gene by "gene dosage" analysis, an experiment that did not 
      require any drug treatment of the cell. Our results provide for the characterization 
      and the structure of the first developmentally regulated gene known to be replicated 
      late in S-phase and abundantly expressed within a eukaryotic cell.

TI  - Is the function of the cdc2 kinase subunit proteins tuned by their propensities to 
      oligomerize? Conformational states in solution of the cdc2 kinase partners p13suc1 
      and p9cksphy.
PG  - 5577-85
AB  - The cdc2 kinase subunit (cks) proteins play an essential function in the control of 
      mitosis through their molecular complexes with the cdc2 kinase. In this work, we 
      characterize the conformational state(s) in solution of the cks proteins p13suc1 
      from Schizosaccharomyces pombe and p9cksphy from Physarum polycephalum. Monomers of 
      p13suc1 and p9cksphy were found to be markedly nonglobular, presumably with a long, 
      nonfolded C-terminal moiety. This was in contrast to the previously published 
      structure of p13suc1, derived from crystallographic studies on a zinc-promoted 
      p13suc1 dimer, in which the individual p13suc1 subunits had a globular conformation. 
      This disparity was resolved when we found that the globular p13suc1 fold undergoes a 
      conformational transition into nonglobular monomers upon dissociation of the dimers 
      following chelation of the zinc ions by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). We 
      also found that p13suc1, but not p9cksphy, forms stable dimers in the absence of 
      metal ions. The topology of these EDTA-insensitive dimers likely resembles that of 
      the human p9ckshs2 protein, characterized by beta 4 strand exchange from each 
      nonglobular monomer.

      the editing sites within these genes that can be directly used to design primers for 
      the experimental verification of these predictions. To obtain good predictions from 
      computational methods, a substantial amount of sequence analysis is necessary that 
      takes into account the idiosyncrasies of the gene of interest and thus cannot be 
      automated. Here, we describe step by step how to use our computational tool 
      Predictor of Insertional Editing (PIE) to locate genes and predict their editing 
      sites using the nad4L genes of the mitochondrial genome of Physarum polycephalum as 
      an example.

TI  - Editing site recognition and nucleotide insertion are separable processes in 
      Physarum mitochondria.
PG  - 6154-61
AB  - Insertional RNA editing in Physarum polycephalum is a complex process involving the 
      specific addition of non-templated nucleotides to nascent mitochondrial transcripts. 
      Since all four ribonucleotides are substrates for the editing activity(s), both the 
      site of insertion and the identity of the nucleotide to be added at a particular 
      position must be specified, but the signals for these events have yet to be 
      elucidated. Here we report the occurrence of sporadic errors in RNAs synthesized in 
      vitro. These mistakes, which include omission of encoded nucleotides as well as 
      misinsertions, occur only on templates that support editing. The pattern of these 
      misediting events indicates that editing site recognition and nucleotide addition 
      are separable events, and that the recognition step involves features of the 
      mitochondrial template that are required for editing. The larger deletions lack all 
      templated nucleotides between editing sites, suggesting that the 
      transcription/editing apparatus can "jump" from one insertion site to another, 
      perhaps mediated by interactions with editing determinants, while smaller omissions 
      most likely reflect misalignment of the transcript upon resumption of templated RNA 
      synthesis.

      poly(beta,L-malic acid).
PG  - 540-50

AB  - Methyl esters of microbial poly(beta,L-malic acid) for conversion degrees of 25, 50, 
      75, and 100% were prepared by treatment of the polyacid with diazomethane. 
      Esterification proceeded with retention of the molecular weight of the parent 
      polyacid and the copolymers displayed a blocky microstructure consisting of short 
      segments of malic and methyl malate sequences. The thermal stability of the 
      copolyesters was lower than those of the parent homopolymers and all of them were 
      fairly crystalline with melting temperatures within the range of 170-175 degrees C. 
      They were degraded rapidly by water, the hydrolysis rate being highly dependent on 
      the methylation degree. Microspheres with mean-average diameters in the range of 
      1-20 microm were prepared from the 100% methylated product by the 
      emulsion-evaporation solvent method. Encapsulation of erythromycin was efficiently 
      performed in these microparticles and its releasing upon incubation in simulated 
      physiological medium was evaluated for different drug loads. Drug delivery was 
      observed to occur by a releasing mechanism largely determined by the 
      hydrodegradation of the host polymer and independent of the amount of loaded drug.

TI  - Identification of a carbohydrate-binding site in Physarum haemagglutinin I.
PG  - 233-40
AB  - Carbohydrate-binding peptides from trypsin-digests of Physarum lectins 
      (haemagglutinins I and II) were isolated by affinity column chromatography. The 
      amino acid sequence of the peptide fragment from haemagglutinin I was determined to 
      be 48TVHQSWY54. A similar amino acid sequence was found in the peptide fragment from 
      haemagglutinin II, in which alignment of valine, histidine, tryptophan and tyrosine 
      was identical. Deletion of the heptapeptide sequence (TVHQSWY) by site-directed 
      mutation abolished the haemagglutinating activity. The replacement of Trp53 by 
      alanine resulted in a complete loss of the haemagglutinating activity, suggesting 
      that the tryptophan residue in the heptapeptide sequence is essential for 
      carbohydrate binding.

TI  - Spontaneous mode switching in coupled oscillators competing for constant amounts of 
      resources.
PG  - 013117
LID - 10.1063/1.3329369 [doi]
AB  - We propose a widely applicable scheme of coupling that models competitions among 
      dynamical systems for fixed amounts of resources. Two oscillators coupled in this 
      way synchronize in antiphase. Three oscillators coupled circularly show a number of 
      oscillation modes such as rotation and partially in-phase synchronization. 
      Intriguingly, simple oscillators in the model also produce complex behavior such as 
      spontaneous switching among different modes. The dynamics reproduces well the 
      spatiotemporal oscillatory behavior of a true slime mold Physarum, which is capable 
      of computational optimization.

TI  - Classification of gravity effects on "free" cells.
PG  - 15-9
AB  - When cell physiologists detect gravity related reactions of their objects it is 
      often difficult to decide where the receptors for the observed effects are located. 
      Answering this question is necessary for any further analysis of a detected gravity 
      effect on cells. In previous papers we have discussed direct and indirect gravity 
      effects in relation to the smallest functional units where the primary receptor, 
      which interacts with gravity, is positioned inside and outside of such a unit, 
      respectively. So, in a first approximation we can conclude that in a multicellular 
      aquatic organism, which changes its metabolism in weightlessness, the primary 
      receptors of gravity are located inside the cells of that organism. A special 
      approach is necessary when free living cells, the density of which may be higher 
      than the one of the (liquid) medium, or even cells living on a free surface are 
      observed. In these two cases also indirect effects have to be taken into account, 
      which will be demonstrated with the aid of the slime mold Physarum polycephalum. 
      Additionally the environment of the organisms can be changed directly and indirectly 
      by gravity.

TI  - LoMAPAM--Logical Model of Autowave Processes of Amoebic Movement.
PG  - 89-95
AB  - This work describes a logical discrete model of the spatiotemporal dynamics of 
      amoebic movement (Logical Model of Autowave Processes of Amoebic Movement (LoMAPAM)) 
      based on finite automata (homogeneous structures) and specified for Physarum 
      polycephalum. The basic system of passing rules for the information and regulation 
      levels of the model, describing the contractile behavior of the ectoplasmic walls of 
      P. polycephalum, enables a rhythmic generation of contractile waves and their 
      propagation in the ectoplasmic wall due to the created structure of the LoMAPAM 
      model. The finite automata corresponds to elementary square planar elements. This 
      construction is alike homogeneous structures with the only exception is its finite. 
      The planar element is assigned to the pair of integers (i,j). The state vector 
      defined for every element (i,j) in discrete time t will have three components. Each 
      of them will be written in one of the matrices B, C, or W. The information matrix B 
      describes the state of the matter. The regulation matrix C, the local Ca(2+) 
      concentration. The flow matrix W describes the local flow of endoplasm or ectoplasm. 
      The passing rules for the state vector was written in the form of Boolean functions. 
      Six actomyosin generators placed on a circle and three and five neighbouring 
      ectoplasmatic generators on a line and a layer of endoplasm were analysed.

TI  - Characterization of calcium-binding light chain as a Ca(2+)-receptive subunit of 
      Physarum myosin.
PG  - 566-70
AB  - Physarum myosin is uniquely under an inhibitory Ca(2+)-regulation in the 
      ATP-dependent interaction with actin [Kohama (1990) Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 11, 
      433-435, for review]. Calcium-binding light chain (CaLc) has been suggested to be of 
      primary importance to the control from its amino acid sequence [Kobayashi et al. 
      (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 305-313]. To provide a biochemical basis for this 
      suggestion, the Ca-binding capacity of CaLc and its Kd for Ca2+ were measured. The 
      Ca-binding properties of CaLc allowed those of Physarum myosin to be explained in 
      terms of CaLc. However, the mode of Ca(2+)-regulation by CaLc differs according to 
      the enzyme upon which Ca-sensitivity is confered by CaLc, i.e., CaLc activated 
      bovine phosphodiesterase activity and inhibited Physarum myosin ATPase activity, 
      with the same Kd in microM levels. Thus, CaLc appears to work as a mere Ca-receptive 
      subunit in Physarum myosin, with the secret of the inhibition lying in other 
      subunits. CaLc was also shown to belong to a family of alkali light chains (AlLc) by 
      allowing it to bind skeletal myosin as a substitute for its AlLc. Therefore, present 
      study is the first biochemical indication that the AlLc family is involved in 
      regulating the myosin function.

TI  - Computational prediction of RNA editing sites.
PG  - 3214-20
AB  - MOTIVATION: Some organisms edit their messenger RNA resulting in differences between 
      the genomic sequence for a gene and the corresponding messenger RNA sequence. This 
      difference complicates experimental and computational attempts to find and study 
      genes in organisms with RNA editing even if the full genomic sequence is known. 
      Nevertheless, knowledge of these editing sites is crucial for understanding the 
      editing machinery of these organisms. RESULTS: We present a computational technique 
      that predicts the position of editing sites in the genomic sequence. It uses a 
      statistical approach drawing on the protein sequences of related genes and general 
      features of editing sites of the organism. We apply the method to the mitochondrion 
      of the slime mold Physarum polycephalum. It correctly predicts over 90% of the amino 
      acids and over 70% of the editing sites.

TI  - Two early replicated, developmentally controlled genes of Physarum display different 
      patterns of DNA replication by two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis.
PG  - 563-74
AB  - The nature of replication origins in eukaryotic chromosomes has been examined in 
      some detail only in yeast, Drosophila, and mammalian cells. We have used highly 
      synchronous cultures of plasmodia of the myxomycete Physarum and two-dimensional 
      agarose gel electrophoresis to examine replication of two developmentally 
      controlled, early replicated genes over time in S-phase. A single, discrete origin 
      of replication was found within 4.8 kb of the LAV1-5 gene, which encodes a homolog 
      of profilin. In contrast, the LAV1-2 gene appears to be surrounded by several 
      origins. Two origins were identified within a 15 kb chromosomal domain and appear to 
      be inefficiently used. Replication forks collide at preferred sites within this 
      domain. These terminating structures are long lived, persisting for at least 2 h of 
      the 3 h S-phase. Analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) 
      within the LAV1-2 domain indicates that replication of alleles on different parental 
      chromosomes is a highly coordinated process. Our studies of the these two early 
      replicated, plasmodium-specific genes indicate that both a fixed, narrow origin 
      region and a broader zone containing two closely spaced origins of DNA replication 
      occur in Physarum.

TI  - A novel labeling technique reveals a function for histone H2A/H2B dimer tail domains 
      in chromatin assembly in vivo.
PG  - 2048-53
AB  - During S phase in eukaryotes, assembly of chromatin on daughter strands is thought 
      to be coupled to DNA replication. However, conflicting evidence exists concerning 
      the role of the highly conserved core histone tail domains in this process. Here we 
      present a novel in vivo labeling technique that was used to examine the role of the 
      amino-terminal tails of the H2A/H2B dimer in replication-coupled assembly in live 
      cells. Our results show that these domains are dispensable for nuclear import but at 
      least one tail is required for replication-dependent, active assembly of H2A/H2B 
      dimers into chromatin in vivo.

AB  - Experiments on insects, higher plants and lower fungi were carried out aboard the 
      biological satellite Cosmos-l129, in Earth orbit, from 25 September to 14 October 
      1979. The main objective of these experiments was to gain more profound knowledge of 
      the effect of weightlessness on living organisms and to study the mechanisms by 
      which these various organisms with different life cycles can adjust and develop in 
      weightlessness. Experiments on insects (Drosophila melanogaster) were made with a 
      view towards understanding gravitational preference in flies, the life cycle of 
      which took place on board the biosatellite under conditions of artificial gravity. 
      Experiments on higher plants (Zea mays, Arabidopsis thaliana, Lycopersicum 
      esculentum) and lower fungi (Physarum polycephalum) were performed.

      called the crystallin fold, and 2. the high intrinsic long-term stability. Spherulin 
      3a (S3a), a dormant protein from the spherules of Physarum polycephalum, is the only 
      known single-domain protein within the beta gamma-crystallin family. Based on 
      sequence homology and 'domain swapping', it has been proposed to represent an 
      evolutionary ancestor of present-day eye lens crystallins. Since S3a is highly 
      expressed in spherulating plasmodia of P. polycephalum under a variety of stress 
      conditions, it can be assumed that the protein may serve as a compatible solute in 
      the cytosol of the slime mold. In order to investigate the stability and other 
      physicochemical properties of a single-domain all-beta protein, we isolated natural 
      S3a. For the large-scale purification, the recombinant protein was cloned and 
      expressed in Escherichia coli. The detailed spectral and biochemical analysis proved 
      the recombinant protein to be authentic. In its native form, S3a is dimeric. Due to 
      its exposed cysteine residues (Cys4), in the absence of reducing agents 
      intermolecular disulfide cross-linking leads to the formation of higher oligomers. 
      In order to preserve the native quaternary structure without aggregation artifacts 
      in denaturation/renaturation experiments, the Cys4-->Ser mutant (S3a C4S) was 
      produced. Both the wild-type protein and its mutant are indistinguishable in their 
      physicochemical properties. At pH 3 - 4, both proteins form a stable compact 
      intermediate (A-state). Concentration-dependent thermal and chemical denaturation 
      showed that the equilibrium unfolding of S3a obeys the simple two-state model with 
      no significant occurrence of folding intermediates.

TI  - Evolutionary relationships of the metazoan beta gamma-crystallins, including that 
      from the marine sponge Geodia cydonium.
PG  - 1077-84
AB  - beta gamma-crystallins are one major component of vertebrate lenses. Here the 
      isolation and characterization of a cDNA, coding for the first beta gamma-crystallin 
      molecule from an invertebrate species, the marine sponge Geodia cydonium, is 
      described. The size of the transcript as determined by Northern blotting was 0.7 kb 
      in length. The deduced amino acid sequence consists of 163 aa residues and comprises 
      four repeated motifs which compose the two domains of the beta gamma-crystallin. 
      Motif 3 contains the characteristic beta gamma-crystallin 'Greek key' motif 
      signature, while in each of the three other repeats, one aa residue is replaced by 
      an aa with the same physico-chemical property. The sponge peptide shows striking 
      similarities to vertebrate beta gamma-crystallins. Analysis by neighbour joining of 
      the sponge motifs with the two motifs present in spherulin 3a of Physarum 
      polycephalum shows that motif 4 of the sponge beta gamma-crystallin was added as the 
      last single sequence to the tree. The data support the view that the beta 
      gamma-crystallin superfamily, present in eukaryotes, evolved from a common ancestor 
      including also the sponge beta gamma-crystallin.

TI  - Extended Eden model reproduces growth of an acellular slime mold.
PG  - 5879-87
AB  - A stochastic growth model was used to simulate the growth of the acellular slime 
      mold Physarum polycephalum on substrates where the nutrients were confined in 
      separate drops. Growth of Physarum on such substrates was previously studied 
      experimentally and found to produce a range of different growth patterns [Phys. Rev. 
      E 57, 941 (1998)]. The model represented the aging of cluster sites and differed 
      from the original Eden model in that the occupation probability of perimeter sites 
      depended on the time of occupation of adjacent cluster sites. This feature led to a 
      bias in the selection of growth directions. A moderate degree of persistence was 
      found to be crucial to reproduce the biological growth patterns under various 
      conditions. Persistence in growth combined quick propagation in heterogeneous 
      environments with a high probability of locating sources of nutrients.

TI  - Mitochondrial RNAs of myxomycetes terminate with non-encoded 3' poly(U) tails.
PG  - 4750-4
AB  - We examined the 3' ends of edited RNAs from the myxomycetes Stemonitis flavogenita 
      and Physarum polycephalum using a modified anchor PCR approach. Surprisingly, we 
      found that poly(A) tails are missing from the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 mRNA 
      (coI) from both species and the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 3 mRNA (cox3) from P. 
      polycephalum. Instead, non-encoded poly(U) tails of varying length were discovered 
      at the 3' ends of these transcripts. These are the first described examples of 3' 
      poly(U) tails on mature mRNAs in any system.

LID - 10.1016/j.biosystems.2008.04.001 [doi]
AB  - We apply a mathematical algorithm which processes discrete time series data to 
      generate a complete list of Petri net structures containing the minimal number of 
      nodes required to reproduce the data set. The completeness of the list as guaranteed 
      by a mathematical proof allows to define a minimal set of experiments required to 
      discriminate between alternative network structures. This in principle allows to 
      prove all possible minimal network structures by disproving all alternative 
      candidate structures. The dynamic behaviour of the networks in terms of a switching 
      rule for the transitions of the Petri net is part of the result. In addition to 
      network reconstruction, the algorithm can be used to determine how many yet 
      undetected components at least must be involved in a certain process. The algorithm 
      also reveals all alternative structural modifications of a network that are required 
      to generate a predefined behaviour.

PG  - 162-6
AB  - We have purified a telomere-binding protein (PPT) from the acellular slime mold 
      Physarum polycephalum. As shown previously (Coren, J.S., Epstein, E.M. and Vogt, 
      V.M. (1991) Mol. Cell. Biol. 11, 2282-2290), in vitro this protein binds 
      specifically to the double stranded (TTAGGG)n repeats that are found at the 
      telomeres of extrachromosomal ribosomal DNA from this organism, and also at 
      telomeres of mammalian chromosomes. PPT was purified from Physarum nuclear extracts 
      by heat treatment at 90 degrees C followed by heparin-agarose fractionation and gel 
      filtration chromatography. The most purified fraction contained two major protein 
      bands of 10 and 7 kDa when analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel 
      electrophoresis. In gel filtration chromatography PPT migrated with a Stokes radius 
      of 1.6 nm. Along with the previously determined sedimentation coefficient of 1.2 S, 
      this value implies a molecular weight of about 8000, making PPT the smallest known 
      telomere-binding protein.

      nucleolar protein fibrillarin of the slime mold Physarum polycephalum. This has been 
      done using a combination of specific chemical and enzymatic cleavage, Western 
      blotting and partial sequencing of fragments. Cleavage with cyanogen bromide reveals 
      four prominent methionine cleavage sites within the protein. Western blotting shows 
      that none of the monoclonal antibody epitopes are dependent on long range 
      interactions. Eight highly-conserved epitopes are clustered in the carboxy terminal 
      half of the protein, while a single less-conserved epitope (for monoclonal antibody 
      P1G12) is located at the amino terminus and appears to lie within the Gly/DMA/Phe 
      domain.

TI  - Tyrophagus putrescentiae (Sarcoptiformes: Acaridae) in the in vitro cultures of 
      slime molds (Mycetozoa): accident, contamination, or interaction?
PG  - 445-458
LID - 10.1007/s10493-021-00608-4 [doi]
AB  - Tyrophagus putrescentiae (Schrank), commonly known as the cereal mite, cheese mite, 
      or ham mite, is a cosmopolitan species reported from various environments in the 
      wild, including soil, plant material and vertebrate nests. It has also been 
      recognized as a common pest of food storages, mycological collections as well as 
      plant and invertebrate laboratory cultures. Laboratory observations indicate that T. 
      putrescentiae feeds on a large range of dermatophytes, yeasts and molds. We have 
      observed the interspecific relation between this mite and several species of true 
      slime molds (Mycetozoa) under laboratory conditions, which confirms the very broad 
      spectrum of feeding habits of T. putrescentiae. Mycetozoans were grown in 
      semi-sterile in vitro cultures and fed with oat flour or oat flakes. Tyrophagus 
      putrescentiae displayed affinity to all macroscopically identifiable stages of the 
      life cycle of Fuligo septica (L.) F.H. Wigg, Physarum polycephalum Schwein and the 
      Didymium sp. complex [Didymium iridis (Ditmar) Fr., Didymium nigripes (Link) Fr. and 
      Didymium bahiense Gottsb.]: live, decaying or dead plasmodia, sporangia, aethalia, 
      spores and sclerotia. The relation carrying symptoms of various types of 
      interspecific interaction, is hypothesized to form an evolutionarily young 
      phenomenon, which not only identifies a new aspect of mycetozoal biology, but also 
      presents the cereal mite as a species of high adaptive potential.

TI  - THE CHANGING PATTERN OF BIREFRINGENCE IN PLASMODIA OF THE SLIME MOLD, PHYSARUM 
      POLYCEPHALUM.
PG  - 361-74
AB  - Plasmodia of the acellular slime mold, Physarum polycephalum, reveal a complex and 
      changing pattern of birefringence when examined with a sensitive polarizing 
      microscope. Positively birefringent fibrils are found throughout the ectoplasmic 
      region of the plasmodium. In the larger strands they may be oriented parallel to the 
      strand axis, or arranged circularly or spirally along the periphery of endoplasmic 
      channels. Some fibrils exist for only a few minutes, others for a longer period. 
      Some, particularly the circular fibrils, undergo changes in birefringence as they 
      undergo cyclic deformations. In the ramifying strand region and the advancing margin 
      there is a tendency for fibrils of various sizes to become organized into mutually 
      orthogonal arrays. In some plasmodia the channel wall material immediately adjacent 
      to the endoplasm has been found to be birefringent. The sign of endoplasmic 
      birefringence is negative, and its magnitude is apparently constant over the 
      streaming cycle. The pattern of plasmodial birefringence and its changes during the 
      shuttle streaming cycle of Physarum are considered in the light of several models 
      designed to explain either cytoplasmic streaming alone or the entire gamut of 
      plasmodial motions. The results of this and other recent physical studies suggest 
      that both streaming and the various other motions of the plasmodium may very likely 
      be explained in terms of coordinated contractions taking place in the fibrils which 
      are rendered visible in polarized light.

TI  - Two alleles of a developmentally regulated alpha-tubulin locus in Physarum 
      polycephalum replicate on different schedules.
PG  - 449-61
AB  - The replication timing of a pair of natural alleles was compared at two 
      alpha-tubulin loci of the Physarum plasmodium. Taking advantage of the naturally 
      synchronous cell cycle of nuclei within the syncytial plasmodium, we analyzed the 
      replication schedule of specific DNA fragments to a resolution of 10-min intervals 
      within a 3-h S phase. At this level of resolution, differences in replication timing 
      between polymorphic alleles at the same locus can be detected in a heterozygote. 
      Specifically, the 3' region of the altA1 allele completes replication at between 20 
      and 40 min of S phase. The same region of the altA2 allele completes replication at 
      between 40 and 80 min of S phase. In contrast, both alleles at the altB locus 
      replicate concurrently within the first 10 to 15 min of S phase. Previous studies 
      showed that both altA and altB are expressed in the plasmodium, their message levels 
      peaking at mitosis, just minutes before the onset of S phase. However, altB message 
      is detected at substantially higher levels than altA message on Northern (RNA) 
      blots. The temporal windows over which the altA alleles each replicate are very 
      broad in comparison with the levels of mitotic synchrony and altB replication 
      synchrony in a single plasmodium. The allele-specific replication schedule of the 
      altA locus demonstrates that the temporal organization of replicons is not strictly 
      conserved between homologous chromosomes.

AB  - Brains are composed of connected neurons that compute by transmitting signals. The 
      neurons are generally fixed in space, but the communication patterns that enable 
      information processing change rapidly. By contrast, other biological systems, such 
      as ant colonies, bacterial colonies, slime moulds and immune systems, process 
      information using agents that communicate locally while moving through physical 
      space. We refer to systems in which agents are strongly connected and immobile as 
      solid, and to systems in which agents are not hardwired to each other and can move 
      freely as liquid. We ask how collective computation depends on agent movement. A 
      liquid cellular automaton (LCA) demonstrates the effect of movement and 
      communication locality on consensus problems. A simple mathematical model predicts 
      how these properties of the LCA affect how quickly information propagates through 
      the system. While solid brains allow complex network structures to move information 
      over long distances, mobility provides an alternative way for agents to transport 
      information when long-range connectivity is expensive or infeasible. Our results 
      show how simple mobile agents solve global information processing tasks more 
      effectively than similar systems that are stationary. This article is part of the 
      theme issue 'Liquid brains, solid brains: How distributed cognitive architectures 
      process information'.

      Polymalic acid hydrolase is expressed in an inactive form that functions as a 
      molecular adapter for polymalic acid trafficking within the plasmodium and is 
      activated only during secretion. Activation follows specific protein tyrosine 
      phosphorylation and dissociation from plasma membranes. Purified inactive Physarum 
      polymalic acid hydrolase, recombinantly expressed in yeast Saccharomyces, is 
      activated on a preparative basis by the addition of plasma membrane fragments from 
      plasmodia of P. polycephalum. Activation of polymalic acid hydrolase and inhibition 
      of polymalic acid synthesis by protein tyrosine phosphorylation are complementary 
      events and could indicate a joint signal response to plasma membrane damage.

TI  - The lysine-rich H1 histones from the slime moulds, Physarum polycephalum and 
      Dictyostelium discoideum lack phosphorylation sites recognised by cyclic 
      AMP-dependent protein kinase in vitro.
PG  - 66-70
AB  - Calcium chloride-extracted histones were prepared from nuclei of the slime moulds, 
      Physarum polycephalum and Dictyostelium discoideum, and phosphorylation by purified 
      preparations of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (cAMP-d PK) and 
      growth-associated H1 histone kinase (HKG) examined and compared. Among the major 
      histone fractions and other proteins in the two preparations, the H1 histones from 
      both organisms were found to be effective and exclusive substrates for HKG. cAMP-d 
      PK, which phosphorylates mammalian H1 histone and certain, in particular H2B, of the 
      mammalian core histones, phosphorylated several of the core histones from both slime 
      moulds but did not phosphorylate H1 histone from either. The slime mould H1s 
      remained ineffective substrates for cAMP-d PK even after extensive alkaline 
      phosphatase treatment of the histone preparations. Additional studies demonstrated 
      that the lack of slime mould H1 phosphorylation by cAMP-d PK was not due to 
      competition of the H1 molecules with the core histones for the kinase. Our studies 
      suggest that H1 histones from these organisms, whilst clearly containing sites for 
      phosphorylation by HKG, apparently lack phosphorylation sites recognised by cAMP-d 
      PK. Thus, the mediation of specific nuclear functions by cAMP-dependent 
      phosphorylation of H1 in higher organisms may not occur or be required in these 
      lower eukaryotes.

AB  - We have developed a transient expression system for the protist Physarum

      for comparing the activities of different promoters in Physarum amoebae, and also 
      for detecting genetic elements that affect the level of gene expression. This system 
      is likely to facilitate improvements in the stable transformation of this organism.

TI  - In vivo phosphorylation of actin in Physarum polycephalum. Study of the substrate 
      specificity of the actin-fragmin kinase.
PG  - 901-8
AB  - Actin-fragmin is a heterodimeric protein complex from Physarum polycephalum 
      microplasmodia that is phosphorylated in vitro at residues Thr203 and Thr202 of the 
      actin subunit by the endogenous actin-fragmin kinase. Following phosphorylation, the 
      F-actin capping activity of the complex becomes Ca(2+)-dependent, suggesting a 
      fundamental regulatory role in controlling F-actin growth [Gettemans, J., De Ville, 
      Y., Waelkens E. and Vandekerckhove, J. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 2644-2651]. In 
      this study we analysed actin phosphorylation in vivo. We demonstrate that the 
      actin-fragmin complex constitutes the only substrate of the actin-fragmin kinase in 
      plasmodia. Monomeric actin is not phosphorylated. Immunoprecipitation of 
      actin-fragmin reveals that approximately 40% of the actin subunit of the complex is 
      phosphorylated in vivo. However, using purified substrate and kinase, the complex 
      can be quantitatively phosphorylated as judged by two-dimensional gel 
      electrophoresis. Through comparative phosphopeptide fingerprinting, we show that the 
      phosphorylation sites in vivo are identical to those identified in vitro. We 
      additionally characterized a complex of actin and the NH2-terminal half of fragmin 
      (residues 1-168) that is also phosphorylated by the same kinase. In contrast to 
      actin-fragmin, phosphorylation of the complex between actin and residues 1-168 of 
      fragmin is independent of Ca2+ because the second Ca(2+)-dependent regulatory 
      actin-binding domain is missing. By artificially varying the actin-fragmin 
      concentration or the actin-fragmin kinase activity present in microplasmodia 
      cytosolic extracts, we attempted to detect alternative protein substrates for the 
      actin-fragmin kinase. The fact that none could be identified suggests that the 
      control and properties of actin-fragmin phosphorylation observed in vitro may stand 
      as a model for F-actin growth control in Physarum cells.

TI  - Involvement of the second messenger cAMP in gravity-signal transduction in Physarum.
PG  - 1311-4
AB  - The aim of the investigation was to clarify, whether cellular signal processing 
      following graviperception involves second messenger pathways. The test object was a 
      most gravisensitive free-living ameboid cell, the myxomycete (acellular slime mold) 
      Physarum polycephalum. It was demonstrated that the motor response is related to 
      acceleration-dependent changes in the levels of the cellular second messenger cyclic 
      adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Rotating Physarum plasmodia in the gravity field of 
      the Earth about a horizontal axis increased their cAMP concentration. Depriving the 
      cells for a few days of the acceleration stimulus (near weightlessness in a space 
      experiment on STS-69) slightly lowered plasmodial cAMP levels. Thus, the results 
      provide first indications that the acceleration-stimulus signal transduction chain 
      of Physarum uses an ubiquitous second messenger pathway.

TI  - SHUTTLE-STREAMING: SYNCHRONIZATION WITH HEAT PRODUCTION IN SLIME MOLD.
PG  - 1485-7
AB  - Two small blobs and a channel excised from a slime mold plasmodium were allowed to 
      fuse into a dumbbell-shaped mass in a thermally insulated Kamiya double chamber 
      equipped with naked bead thermistors in contact with the blobs. Cyclic temperature 
      differences of from 1 X 10(-4) to 5 X 10(-2) deg Celsius were recorded by a 
      sensitive lock-in amplifier method with a basal noise level of less than 2 X 
      10(-2)deg Celsius and a time constant of 0.5 second. The temperature differences 
      were caused by periodic bursts of heat production synchronized perfectly with the 
      shuttle-streaming cycle and invariably localized at the source rather than the 
      destination of the streaming cytoplasm. The results support the theory that the 
      motive force for cytoplasmic streaming in the slime mold is pressure, probably 
      generated by contraction of elements in the channel walls.

TI  - Histone proteins in vivo: cell-cycle-dependent physiological effects of exogenous 
      linker histones incorporated into Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 140-50
AB  - We detail a method which allows biochemical quantities of histone proteins to be 
      introduced into a living eukaryotic cell. This method involves absorption of 
      purified proteins into macroplasmodia of Physarum polycephalum. Further, since 
      Physarum macroplasmodia exist as syncitial culture with completely synchronous 
      nuclei with respect to cell cycle events, proteins may be introduced at specific 
      points during the eukaryotic cell cycle. We show that a linker histone is absorbed 
      whole into these cells and are properly transported to the nuclei of the cell. 
      Furthermore, we also show incorporation of linker histone H5 inhibits the 
      transcriptional activities occurring during the G2 phase in Physarum. This method 
      will make it possible to introduce histones modified with structural probes into 
      chromatin naturally assembled in vivo.

TI  - Crystallization and preliminary X-ray studies of I-PpoI: a nuclear, intron-encoded 
      homing endonuclease from Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 2677-80
AB  - The homing endonuclease I-PpoI is encoded by an optional third intron, Pp LSU 3, 
      found in nuclear, extrachromosomal copies of the Physarum polycephalum 26S rRNA 
      gene. This endonuclease promotes the lateral transfer or "homing" of its encoding 
      intron by recognizing and cleaving a partially symmetric, 15 bp homing site in 26S 
      rDNA alleles that lack the Pp LSU 3 intron. The open reading frame encoding I-PpoI 
      has been subcloned, and the endonuclease has been overproduced in E. coli. Purified 
      recombinant I-PpoI has been co-crystallized with a 21 bp homing site DNA duplex. The 
      crystals belong to space group P3(1)21, with unit cell dimensions a = b = 114 A, c = 
      89 A. The results of initial X-ray diffraction experiments indicate that the 
      asymmetric unit contains an enzyme homodimer and one duplex DNA molecule, and that 
      the unit cell has a specific volume of 3.4 A3/dalton. These experiments also provide 
      strong evidence that I-PpoI contains several bound zinc ions as part of its 
      structure.

TI  - Complete characterization of the edited transcriptome of the mitochondrion of 
      Physarum polycephalum using deep sequencing of RNA.
PG  - 6044-55
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkr180 [doi]
AB  - RNAs transcribed from the mitochondrial genome of Physarum polycephalum are heavily 
      edited. The most prevalent editing event is the insertion of single Cs, with Us and 
      dinucleotides also added at specific sites. The existence of insertional editing 
      makes gene identification difficult and localization of editing sites has relied 
      upon characterization of individual cDNAs. We have now determined the complete 
      mitochondrial transcriptome of Physarum using Illumina deep sequencing of purified 
      mitochondrial RNA. We report the first instances of A and G insertions and sites of 
      partial and extragenic editing in Physarum mitochondrial RNAs, as well as an 
      additional 772 C, U and dinucleotide insertions. The notable lack of antisense RNAs 
      in our non-size selected, directional library argues strongly against an RNA-guided 
      editing mechanism. Also of interest are our findings that sites of C to U changes 
      are unedited at a significantly higher frequency than insertional editing sites and 
      that substitutional editing of neighboring sites appears to be coupled. Finally, in 
      addition to the characterization of RNAs from 17 predicted genes, our data 
      identified nine new mitochondrial genes, four of which encode proteins that do not 
      resemble other proteins in the database. Curiously, one of the latter mRNAs contains 
      no editing sites.

TI  - Cell morphological, ontogenic, and genetic reactions to 0-g simulation and hyper-g.
PG  - 47-50
AB  - Organisms use gravity for spatial orientation, and differentiation into species 
      during evolution follows geological processes which are caused by gravity. On the 
      other hand, the task of most organismic functions which have or may have a relation 
      to gravity is to compensate gravity. Furthermore, today it is very obvious that 
      organisms do not disintegrate under the conditions of weightlessness, at least for 
      the currently tested durations. These previous statements indicate a large field of 
      still unknown regulation and adaptation mechanisms. Experiments to simulate 
      weightlessness on the fast clinostat and with hyper-g show a highly developed 
      ability of the genetic chain and of differentiating cells in being autonomous 
      against mechanical stresses caused by outer accelerations. Nevertheless, different 
      strong and slight changes of different tested end points were found. The question 
      remains if the cells react actively or only passively.

TI  - Apoptotic cell death induced by physarumin (hemagglutinin from myxomycete, Physarum 
      polycephalum).
PG  - 214-8
AB  - Physarumin, a carbohydrate-binding protein (hemagglutinin or lectin), was isolated 
      from the plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum. Physarumin agglutinated not only 
      several species of erythrocytes but also tumor cells such as AH109A ascites hepatoma 
      cells, sarcoma 180 ascites cells and mouse leukemia P388 cell lines. Physarumin had 
      tumor cell growth-inhibitory activity, and induced the apoptosis of P388 cell lines. 
      Physarumin-induced apoptosis required binding to a 68 kDa counter-receptor on the 
      P388 cell surface. Since the agglutinating and antiproliferative activities of 
      physarumin were inhibited by asialofetuin and thyroglobulin, respectively, it is 
      suggested that physarumin reacts with the galactose moiety of carbohydrate chains of 
      physarumin receptor.

TI  - An unusual actin-encoding gene in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 79-86
AB  - Actin is one of the most conserved proteins in eukaryotic organisms. In the present 
      work, we cloned and determined the nucleotide sequence of an unusual actin-encoding 
      gene, ardD, from the slime mold, Physarum polycephalum. The ardD gene encodes an 
      ArdD protein containing 367 amino acids (aa) instead of the 375-376 aa found in a 
      typical actin. The nine missing aa are accounted for by deletions of three aa in the 
      first exon, five in the fifth exon and one in the sixth exon. These deletions in the 
      coding sequence were observed in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-generated cDNA 
      fragment, which excludes the possibility of a cloning artifact. In addition, ArdD 
      contains numerous aa substitutions distributed throughout the protein. The ArdD aa 
      sequence was compared with published actin sequences. The most identity is seen with 
      the P. polycephalum ArdA, ArdB and ArdC (84%) and Acanthamoeba (82%) actins, while 
      the least identity is found with Tetrahymena actin (67%). The expression of the ardD 
      gene is developmentally regulated. The highest levels of ardD mRNA were found in 
      spherules, less was seen in plasmodia and no detectable transcripts were observed in 
      amoebae. The PCR amplification of an ardD cDNA from spherules confirmed the presence 
      of mRNA in this developmental stage. The aa deletions and substitutions in the 
      predicted ArdD aa sequence make it one of the most distinctive actins known.

TI  - Cloning and characterization of Physarum polycephalum tectonins. Homologues of 
      Limulus lectin L-6.
PG  - 6565-74
AB  - Previous investigators have reported the presence of two dominant proteins, tectonin 
      I (25 kDa) and tectonin II (39 kDa), in nuclei and nuclear matrix from plasmodia of 
      Physarum polycephalum. We demonstrate, by a modification of the nuclear isolation 
      protocol and by protease sensitivity, that the tectonins are not nuclear proteins 
      but rather are located on the exterior surface of the plasma membrane. We report the 
      sequences of cDNAs of tectonins I and II, which encode 217 and 353 amino acids, 
      respectively. Tectonin I is homologous to the C-terminal two-thirds of tectonin II. 
      Both proteins contain six tandem repeats that are each 33-37 amino acids in length 
      and define a new consensus sequence. Homologous repeats are found in L-6, a 
      bacterial lipopolysaccharide-binding lectin from horseshoe crab hemocytes. The 
      repetitive sequences of the tectonins and L-6 are reminiscent of the WD repeats of 
      the beta-subunit of G proteins, suggesting that they form beta-propeller domains. 
      Tectonin II has an additional N-terminal domain that includes a 47-residue sequence 
      highly similar to the galactoside-binding sequence of the B-chain of ricin. The 
      tectonins may be lectins that function as part of a transmembrane signaling complex 
      during phagocytosis.

TI  - Reversible histone modifications and the chromosome cell cycle.
PG  - 9-16
AB  - During the eukaryotic cell cycle, chromosomes undergo large structural transitions 
      and spatial rearrangements that are associated with the major cell functions of 
      genome replication, transcription and chromosome condensation to metaphase 
      chromosomes. Eukaryotic cells have evolved cell cycle dependent processes that 
      modulate histone:DNA interactions in chromosomes. These are; i) acetylations of 
      lysines; ii) phosphorylations of serines and threonines and iii) ubiquitinations of 
      lysines. All of these reversible modifications are contained in the well-defined 
      very basic N- and C-terminal domains of histones. Acetylations and phosphorylations 
      markedly affect the charge densities of these domains whereas ubiquitination adds a 
      bulky globular protein, ubiquitin, to lysines in the C-terminal tails of H2A and 
      H2B. Histone acetylations are strictly associated with genome replication and 
      transcription; histone H1 and H3 phosphorylations correlate with the process of 
      chromosome condensation. The subunits of histone H1 kinase have now been shown to be 
      cyclins and the p34CDC2 kinase product of the cell cycle control gene CDC2. It is 
      probable that all of the processes that control chromosome structure:function 
      relationships are also involved in the control of the cell cycle.

TI  - A unique U5-->A substitution in the Physarum polycephalum U1 snRNA: evidence at the 
      RNA and gene levels.
PG  - 425-35
AB  - The 5' terminal sequence of U1 snRNA that base-pairs with the intron 5' splice site 
      in the course of spliceosome assembly was considered to be universally conserved. A 
      study of the P polycephalum U1 snRNA at both RNA and gene levels shows that there 
      are exceptions to this rule: the P polycephalum U1 snRNA has a U to A substitution 
      at position 5, that is partially compensated by a high frequency of T residue at 
      position +4 of introns. In contrast to the yeast genome, the P polycephalum genome 
      contains several U1 snRNA coding sequences (about 20). They either encode the U1A 
      snRNA expressed in microplasmodia or correspond to the previously cloned U1B coding 
      sequence. Both coding sequences show the U5A substitution. The ratio of U1A versus 
      U1B coding sequences is of about 3. A U1A gene was cloned. The 60 nt region upstream 
      of the coding sequence has the same sequence as in the U1B gene. The U1B gene is 
      probably expressed at another stage of the P polycephalum life cycle.

TI  - Stimulation of the interaction between actin and myosin by Physarum caldesmon-like 
      protein and smooth muscle caldesmon.
PG  - 21784-90
AB  - We have purified an actin-binding protein from the plasmodia of a lower eukaryote, 
      Physarum polycephalum, with an apparent molecular mass of 210,000 daltons on sodium 
      dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This protein bound to actin 
      filaments with a stoichiometry of 1:7-8 in a Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent manner. 
      Antibody raised against caldesmon from smooth muscle cross-reacted with the 210-kDa 
      protein. In vitro motility assay revealed that the 210-kDa protein increased the 
      sliding velocity of actin filaments on Physarum myosin. The 210-kDa protein more 
      than doubled the actin-activated ATPase activity of Physarum myosin under 
      comparative conditions of in vitro motility assay. Further increases in the 
      concentration of the 210-kDa protein decreased its stimulatory effects. 
      Ca(2+)-calmodulin prevented the stimulatory effects of the 210-kDa protein. 
      Unexpectedly, smooth muscle caldesmon also increased the sliding velocity of actin 
      filaments on smooth muscle myosin at lower concentrations. The well-known inhibitory 
      effect of smooth muscle caldesmon on the actin-myosin interaction was observed with 
      this motility assay when the concentration of the caldesmon was increased further. 
      The stimulatory and inhibitory effects were confirmed by measurements of 
      actin-activated ATPase activity of smooth muscle myosin. From estimations of the 
      intracellular concentrations of the 210-kDa protein and smooth muscle caldesmon in 
      vivo, it appears that effects of the former and the latter on actin-myosin 
      interactions in vivo are stimulatory and inhibitory, respectively.

TI  - Alkaline phosphatase of Physarum polycephalum is insoluble.
PG  - 151-6
AB  - The plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum grow as multinucleated cells in the presence 
      of sufficient humidity and nutriment. Under non-illuminating conditions, stresses 
      such as low temperature or high concentrations of salts transform the plasmodia into 
      spherules whereas dehydration induces sclerotization. Some phosphatases including 
      protein phosphatase and acid phosphatase have been purified from the plasmodia, but 
      alkaline phosphatase remains to be elucidated. Phosphatase of the plasmodia, 
      spherules and sclerotia was visualized by electrophoresis gel-staining assay using 
      5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. Insoluble fractions of the sclerotia were 
      abundant in phosphatase activity. The phosphatase which was extracted by nonionic 
      detergent was subjected to column chromatography and preparative electrophoresis. 
      Purified phosphatase showed the highest activity at pH 8.8, indicating that this 
      enzyme belongs to alkaline phosphatase. The apparent molecular mass from sodium 
      dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under non-reducing condition was 
      estimated to be 100 kDa whereas that under reducing was 105 kDa. An amount of 1% 
      sodium dodecyl sulfate or 0.5 M NaCl had no effects on the activity although the 
      phosphatase showed heat instability, Mg(2+)-dependency and sensitivity to 
      2-glycerophosphate or NaF. The extracting conditions and enzymatic properties 
      suggest that this alkaline phosphatase which is in a membrane-bound form plays 
      important roles in phosphate metabolism.

TI  - Accurate and efficient insertional RNA editing in isolated Physarum mitochondria.
PG  - 681-91
AB  - RNA editing is a process whereby nucleotide insertion, deletion, or base 
      substitution results in the production of an RNA whose sequence differs from that of 
      its template. The mitochondrial RNAs of Physarum polycephalum are processed 
      specifically at multiple sites by both mono- and dinucleotide insertions, as well as 
      apparent cytidine (C) to uridine (U) changes. The precise mechanism and timing of 
      these processing events are currently unknown. We describe here the development of 
      an isolated mitochondrial system in which exogenously supplied nucleotides can be 
      incorporated into RNAs under defined conditions. The results of S1 nuclease 
      protection, nearest neighbor and RNase T1 fingerprint analyses indicate that the 
      vast majority of these newly synthesized mitochondrial RNAs have been accurately and 
      efficiently processed by both mono- and dinucleotide insertions. This work provides 
      a direct demonstration of faithful nucleotide insertion in a mitochondrial editing 
      system. In contrast, the newly synthesized RNAs are not processed by C to U changes 
      in the isolated mitochondria, suggesting that the base changes observed in Physarum 
      are unlikely to occur via a deletion/insertion mechanism.

TI  - A novel endogenous PP2C-like phosphatase dephosphorylates casein kinase 
      II-phosphorylated Physarum fragmin.
PG  - 438-44
AB  - Plasmodial fragmin, a Physarum polycephalum F-actin severing and capping protein, is 
      phosphorylated by casein kinase II at Ser(266) (De Corte, V., Gettemans, J., De 
      Ville, Y., Waelkens, E., and Vandekerckchove, J. (1996), Biochemistry 35, 
      5472-5480). In this study, we report the purification and characterization of the 
      corresponding fragmin phosphatases. One of the enzymes was purified to near 
      homogeneity from a cytosolic extract; it dephosphorylates CKII-phosphorylated 
      fragmin, a peptide encompassing the CKII phosphorylation site of fragmin as well as 
      histone 2A, CKII-phosphorylated casein and the CKII model-peptide substrate: 
      R(3)E(3)S(P)E(3). Its activity was highly stimulated by Mn(2+) and Mg(2+), and based 
      on its lack of sensitivity toward phosphatase effectors we could exclude 
      similarities with PP1, PP2A and PP2B phosphatases. All biochemical properties of the 
      phosphatase point to a PP2C-like enzyme. A second phosphatase dephosphorylating 
      fragmin was identified as a Physarum alkaline phosphatase.

TI  - Nuclear matrix and the cell cycle.
PG  - 377-403
AB  - The facts that the nuclear matrix represents a structural framework of the cell 
      nucleus and that nuclear events, such as DNA replication, transcription, and DNA 
      repair, are associated with this skeletal structure suggest that its components are 
      subject to cell cycle-regulatory mechanisms. Cell cycle regulation has been shown 
      for nuclear lamina assembly and disassembly during mitosis and chromatin 
      reorganization. Little attention has so far been paid to internal nuclear matrix 
      proteins and matrix-associated proteins with respect to the cell cycle. This survey 
      attempts to summarize available data and presents experimental evidence that 
      important metabolic functions of the nucleus are regulated by the transient, cell 
      cycle-dependent attachment of enzymes and regulatory proteins to the nuclear matrix. 
      Results on thymidine kinase and RNA polymerase during the synchronous cell cycle of 
      Physarum polycephalum demonstrate that reversible binding to the nuclear matrix 
      represents an additional level of regulation for nuclear processes.

AB  - We used a novel single-cell strategy to examine the fate of histones during 
      G(2)-phase. Consistent with previous results, we find that in G(2)-phase, the 
      majority of nuclear histones are assembled into chromatin, whereas a small fraction 
      comprises an unassembled pool. Small increases in the amount of histones within the 
      free pool affect the extent of exchange, suggesting that the free pool is in dynamic 
      equilibrium with chromatin proteins. Unexpectedly, acetylated H4 is preferentially 
      partitioned to the unassembled pool. Although an increase in global histone 
      acetylation did not affect overall nucleosome dynamics, an H4 containing lysine to 
      glutamine substitutions as mimics of acetylation significantly increased the rate of 
      exchange, but did not affect the acetylation state of neighbouring nucleosomes. 
      Interestingly, transcribed regions are particularly predisposed to exchange on 
      incorporation of H4 acetylation mimics compared with surrounding regions. Our 
      results support a model whereby histone acetylation on K8 and K16 specifically marks 
      nucleosomes for eviction, with histones being rapidly deacetylated on reassembly.

TI  - The Physarum polycephalum Genome Reveals Extensive Use of Prokaryotic Two-Component 
      and Metazoan-Type Tyrosine Kinase Signaling.
PG  - 109-25
LID - 10.1093/gbe/evv237 [doi]
AB  - Physarum polycephalum is a well-studied microbial eukaryote with unique experimental 
      attributes relative to other experimental model organisms. It has a sophisticated 
      life cycle with several distinct stages including amoebal, flagellated, and 
      plasmodial cells. It is unusual in switching between open and closed mitosis 
      according to specific life-cycle stages. Here we present the analysis of the genome 
      of this enigmatic and important model organism and compare it with closely related 
      species. The genome is littered with simple and complex repeats and the coding 
      regions are frequently interrupted by introns with a mean size of 100 bases. 
      Complemented with extensive transcriptome data, we define approximately 31,000 gene 
      loci, providing unexpected insights into early eukaryote evolution. We describe 
      extensive use of histidine kinase-based two-component systems and tyrosine kinase 
      signaling, the presence of bacterial and plant type photoreceptors (phytochromes, 
      cryptochrome, and phototropin) and of plant-type pentatricopeptide repeat proteins, 
      as well as metabolic pathways, and a cell cycle control system typically found in 
      more complex eukaryotes. Our analysis characterizes P. polycephalum as a 
      prototypical eukaryote with features attributed to the last common ancestor of 
      Amorphea, that is, the Amoebozoa and Opisthokonts. Specifically, the presence of 
      tyrosine kinases in Acanthamoeba and Physarum as representatives of two distantly 
      related subdivisions of Amoebozoa argues against the later emergence of tyrosine 
      kinase signaling in the opisthokont lineage and also against the acquisition by 
      horizontal gene transfer.

TI  - Polymalic acid-based nano biopolymers for targeting of multiple tumor markers: an 
      opportunity for personalized medicine?
LID - 10.3791/50668 [doi]
LID - 50668
AB  - Tumors with similar grade and morphology often respond differently to the same 
      treatment because of variations in molecular profiling. To account for this 
      diversity, personalized medicine is developed for silencing malignancy associated 
      genes. Nano drugs fit these needs by targeting tumor and delivering antisense 
      oligonucleotides for silencing of genes. As drugs for the treatment are often 
      administered repeatedly, absence of toxicity and negligible immune response are 
      desirable. In the example presented here, a nano medicine is synthesized from the 
      biodegradable, non-toxic and non-immunogenic platform polymalic acid by controlled 
      chemical ligation of antisense oligonucleotides and tumor targeting molecules. The 
      synthesis and treatment is exemplified for human Her2-positive breast cancer using 
      an experimental mouse model. The case can be translated towards synthesis and 
      treatment of other tumors.

TI  - Subcellular location of enzymes involved in core histone acetylation.
PG  - 14887-95
AB  - Multiple enzyme forms of histone deacetylase and histone acetyltransferase exist in 
      germinating maize embryos. We analyzed the association of the different enzymes to 
      chromatin by ion exchange chromatography of subcellular fractions from different 
      time points of embryo germination. The vast majority of histone deacetylase HD-1A 
      was not bound to chromatin, since it was solubilized during chromatin isolation, 
      regardless of its phosphorylation state and the phase of embryo germination. In 
      contrast, HD-2 was chromatin bound during the entire germination pathway. Histone 
      deacetylase HD-1B was present in a chromatin-bound and a soluble form; the ratio 
      between these two forms changed during germination. Both nuclear histone 
      acetyltransferases, HAT-A1 and HAT-A2, were tightly chromatin-bound and could only 
      be released from chromatin by salt extraction. To test whether histone 
      acetyltransferases or deacetylases are associated with the nuclear matrix, we 
      analyzed nuclear matrix preparations from yeast, Physarum, and maize step by step 
      for both enzyme activities. This analysis confirmed that part of the activity is 
      chromatin bound, but no significant enzyme activity could be found in the final 
      nuclear matrix, regardless of the preparation protocol. This result was further 
      substantiated by detailed analysis of histone deacetylases and acetyltransferases 
      during cellular fractionation and nuclear matrix preparation of chicken 
      erythrocytes. Altogether our results suggest that the participation of these enzymes 
      in different nuclear processes may partly be regulated by a distinct location to 
      intranuclear components.

TI  - A single gamma-tubulin gene and mRNA, but two gamma-tubulin polypeptides differing 
      by their binding to the spindle pole organizing centres.
PG  - 2483-92
AB  - Cells of eukaryotic organisms exhibit microtubules with various functions during the 
      different developmental stages. The identification of multiple forms of alpha- and 
      beta-tubulins had raised the question of their possible physiological roles. In the 
      myxomycete Physarum polycephalum a complex polymorphism for alpha- and beta-tubulins 
      has been correlated with a specific developmental expression pattern. Here, we have 
      investigated the potential heterogeneity of gamma-tubulin in this organism. A single 
      gene, with 3 introns and 4 exons, and a single mRNA coding for gamma-tubulin were 
      detected. They coded for a polypeptide of 454 amino acids, with a predicted 
      molecular mass of 50,674, which presented 64-76% identity with other gamma-tubulins. 
      However, immunological studies identified two gamma-tubulin polypeptides, both 
      present in the two developmental stages of the organism, uninucleate amoebae and 
      multinucleate plasmodia. The two gamma-tubulins, called gamma s- and gamma f-tubulin 
      for slow and fast electrophoretic mobility, exhibited apparent molecular masses of 
      52,000 and 50,000, respectively. They were recognized by two antibodies (R70 and 
      JH46) raised against two distinct conserved sequences of gamma-tubulins. They were 
      present both in the preparations of amoebal centrosomes possessing two centrioles 
      and in the preparations of plasmodial nuclear metaphases devoid of structurally 
      distinct polar structures. These two gamma-tubulins exhibited different 
      sedimentation properties as shown by ultracentrifugation and sedimentation in 
      sucrose gradients. Moreover, gamma s-tubulin was tightly bound to microtubule 
      organizing centers (MTOCs) while gamma f-tubulin was loosely associated with these 
      structures. This first demonstration of the presence of two gamma-tubulins with 
      distinct properties in the same MTOC suggests a more complex physiological role than 
      previously assumed.

TI  - A novel endonuclease mechanism directly visualized for I-PpoI.
PG  - 1096-9
AB  - A novel mechanism of DNA endonucleolytic cleavage has been visualized for the homing 
      endonuclease I-PpoI by trapping the uncleaved enzyme-substrate complex and comparing 
      it to the previously visualized product complex. This enzyme employs a unique single 
      metal mechanism. A magnesium ion is coordinated by an asparagine residue and two DNA 
      oxygen atoms and stabilizes the phosphoanion transition state and the 3'oxygen 
      leaving group. A hydrolytic water molecule is activated by a histidine residue for 
      an in-line attack on the scissile phosphate. A strained enzyme-substrate-metal 
      complex is formed before cleavage, then relaxed during the reaction.

TI  - A novel type of protein kinase phosphorylates actin in the actin-fragmin complex.
PG  - 5547-56
AB  - Actin-fragmin kinase (AFK) from Physarum polycephalum specifically phosphorylates 
      actin in the EGTA-resistant 1:1 actin-fragmin complex. The cDNA deduced amino acid 
      sequence reveals two major domains of approximately 35 kDa each that are separated 
      by a hinge-like proline/serine-rich segment of 50 residues. Whereas the N-terminal 
      domain does not show any significant similarity to protein sequences from databases, 
      there are six complete kelch repeats in the protein that comprise almost the entire 
      C-terminal half of the molecule. To prove the intrinsic phosphorylation activity of 
      AFK, full-length or partial cDNA fragments were expressed both in a reticulocyte 
      lysate and in Escherichia coli. In both expression systems, we obtained specific 
      actin phosphorylation and located the catalytic domain in the N-terminal half. 
      Interestingly, this region did not contain any of the known protein kinase consensus 
      sequences. The only known sequence motif present that could have been involved in 
      nucleotide binding was a nearly perfect phosphate binding loop (P-loop). However, 
      introduction of two different point mutations into this putative P-loop sequence did 
      not alter the catalytic activity of the kinase, which indicates an as yet unknown 
      mechanism for phosphate transfer. Our data suggest that AFK belongs to a new class 
      of protein kinases and that this actin phosphorylation might be the first example of 
      a widely distributed novel type of regulation of the actin cytoskeleton in 
      non-muscle cells.

TI  - Xenopus oocytes express multiple receptors for LPA-like lipid mediators.
PG  - C772-7
AB  - In Xenopus laevis oocytes, both lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and a cyclic 
      phosphate-containing analogue 1-acyl-sn-glycero-2,3-cyclic phosphate (cLPA) isolated 
      from Physarum polycephalum activated oscillatory Cl- currents. cLPA elicited 
      oscillatory currents only when applied extracellularly and, similarly to LPA, evoked 
      homologous desensitization. cLPA applied to oocytes previously desensitized b y LPA 
      failed to elicit a current, indicating that LPA completely desensitized the cLPA 
      receptors. In contrast, when oocytes were desensitized by cLPA, LPA still evoked 
      large currents. The lack of heterologous desensitization between cLPA and LPA 
      indicates that the former acts on a distinct receptor subpopulation(s), which is 
      also activated by LPA. The alkyl-ether analogue 
      1-hexadecyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (16:0-GP) and dioleoyl-phosphatidic acid 
      (18:1-PA) showed heterologous desensitization patterns similar to that of LPA with 
      regard to cLPA. Complete heterologous desensitization was obtained between LPA and 
      16:0-GP or 18:1-PA. These observations demonstrate the simultaneous expression of at 
      least two different types of receptors for LPA-like lipid mediators on Xenopus 
      oocytes and that these receptors show different pharmacological properties in their 
      selectivity to cLPA.

AB  - The plasmodial stage of Physarum polycephalum contains up to 10(9) nuclei which 
      undergo a naturally synchronous mitosis every 8 h. Nuclear processes such as DNA and 
      RNA synthesis as well as many cytoplasmic processes such as histone synthesis are 
      also synchronous. Physarum polycephalum is therefore widely used in studies of 
      cell-cycle events. This article describes experiments that may help to explain two 
      fundamental biological processes: (1) the mechanism that triggers mitosis, (2) the 
      structural basis of mitotic movement.

      polycephalum (author's transl)].
PG  - 23-41
AB  - Plasmodial veins of Physarum polycephalum were investigated by combining 
      cinematographical and tensiometrical methods. Veins remaining on their original 
      growing substrate show characteristic surface movements resulting from an intrinsic 
      contraction automaticity. Radial and longitudinal components of surface movements 
      were registered simultaneously. Both contraction activities show identical 
      frequencies, in contrast to results derived from experiments with isolated veins. 
      There is only one genuine frequency and therefore one has not necessarily to suppose 
      the existence of a cooperation of two oscillating systems underlying the rhythmic 
      contraction phenomena. The results are discussed in respect to the basis of the 
      contraction phenomena: the cytoplasmic actomyosin fibrils of Physarum and their

AB  - In Physarum polycephalum two fractions of ADPR-protein conjugates could be 
      differentiated on the basis of their susceptibility towards hydroxylamine. 
      Quantitation during the cell cycle revealed independent synthesis of the two 
      species, the NH2OH-resistant fraction being formed during S phase, while the 
      NH2OH-sensitive conjugate increased sharply at the S/G2 boundary. These findings 
      indicated that nuclear ADP-ribosylation reactions are more than one function.

AB  - The histones from slime mold Physarum polycephalum and calf thymus were 
      characterized in terms of some physico-chemical properties. The molecular weights of 
      six principal histone fractions of Ph. polycephalum were found to be the following: 
      P1--22 700, P3--15 700, P4a--15 000, P4b--14 300, P5--12 800 and P6--10 500. 
      Electrophoretically homogenous histone fractions H1, H2b and H4 of calf thymus and 
      histones P1, P3, P4b and P6 of slime mold were obtained by gel-filtration on Acrylex 
      P-60. These findings suggest that fractions P1, P4a, P4b, P5 and P6 of slime mold 
      Ph. polycephalum are homologus with respect to the histone fractions H1, H3, H2b, 
      H2a and H4 of calf thymus. Only fraction P3 has no corresponding fraction in the 
      calf thymus histones; a fraction corresponding to histone P3 of slime mold was 
      absent.

AB  - The true slime mould Physarum polycephalum was treated with various agents by 
      spraying them upon the cell surface 4 hrs before the second synchronous mitosis. The 
      onset of mitosis was considerably approximated after the plasmodium treatment with 
      protein kinases from rat hepatoma or Ph. polycephalum at the late G2 phase. The 
      catalytic and regulatory subunits of cAMP-dependent pig brain protein kinase caused 
      retardation of mitosis, while the holoenzyme, casein kinase and alkaline phosphatase 
      did not affect the timing of mitosis. The cyclic nucleotides and inhibitors of their 
      metabolic enzymes were used to investigate the role of phosphorylation processes in 
      the mitotic cycle.

AB  - The plasmodium of slime mold Physarum polycephalum behaves as an amorphous 
      reaction-diffusion computing substrate and is capable of apparently 'intelligent' 
      behavior. But how does intelligence emerge in an acellular organism? Through a range 
      of laboratory experiments, we visualize the plasmodial cytoskeleton-a ubiquitous 
      cellular protein scaffold whose functions are manifold and essential to life-and 
      discuss its putative role as a network for transducing, transmitting and structuring 
      data streams within the plasmodium. Through a range of computer modeling techniques, 
      we demonstrate how emergent behavior, and hence computational intelligence, may 
      occur in cytoskeletal communications networks. Specifically, we model the topology 
      of both the actin and tubulin cytoskeletal networks and discuss how computation may 
      occur therein. Furthermore, we present bespoke cellular automata and particle swarm 
      models for the computational process within the cytoskeleton and observe the 
      incidence of emergent patterns in both. Our work grants unique insight into the 
      origins of natural intelligence; the results presented here are therefore readily 
      transferable to the fields of natural computation, cell biology and biomedical 
      science. We conclude by discussing how our results may alter our biological, 
      computational and philosophical understanding of intelligence and consciousness.

PG  - 1273-7
AB  - The thermostabilities of the "unordered" and shuttle protoplasmic streamings in 
      myxomycete Physarum polycephalum plasmodia was studied. A comparison of these 
      thermostabilities has revealed that the cessation of the former streaming occurs at 
      temperatures higher than those required for arresting the shuttle streaming. The 
      difference between the two types of protoplasmic streamings is better seen in the 
      rate of repair of protoplasmic streaming halted by a 10 minutes heating at 38-41 
      degrees C. For example, the unordered streaming is restored 2 minutes after heating 
      plasmodia at 39 degrees for 10 min., while the shuttle streaming is resumed in 24 
      minutes. It is supposed that the two protoplasmic streamings are independent to an 
      appreciable extent, and that the shuttle streaming, being more complex and 
      coordinated, has appeared in the evolution at later stages than the unordered one. 
      The higher heat sensitivity of the shuttle streaming substantiates a view of the 
      lower stability to injury in regulatory mechanisms if compared to the stability of 
      motile mechanisms.

AB  - The rate constants of 1H--3H exchange between water and C8H-groups of purinic 
      residues of DNA in solution and in nuclei of synchronous Physarum polycephalum at 
      different phases of the cell cycle were measured. The nuclear membranes and 
      nonhistone proteins were shown not to create additional hindrances and not to 
      diminish the availability of DNA in nuclei for solvent molecules. A small increase 
      of the rate of the 1H--3H exchange between water and the DNA of nuclei upon 
      transition from the S-phase to the late G2-phase seems to reflect the process of 
      chromatin decondensation connected with activation of the transcription and local 
      changes of the secondary structure of DNA at the late G2-phase of the cell cycle.

      accompanied by a slight (approximately 1.6 fold) change in concentration of 
      endogenous RNA-polymerase II. Using mild fragmentation of chromatin nuclei by 
      micrococcal nuclease and DEAE-Sephadex chromatography the bound enzyme was shown to 
      consist of two forms differing in the degree of their binding to the template and in 
      functional significance. Transcription in the Physarum polycephalum nuclei can be 
      regulated by changes in the correlation of these forms.

AB  - Roots of the medicinal plant Valeriana officinalis are well-studied for their 
      various biological activities. We applied genetically transformed V. officinalis 
      root biomass to exert control of Physarum polycephalum, an amoeba-based emergent 
      computing substrate. The plasmodial stage of the P. polycephalum life cycle 
      constitutes a single, multinucleate cell visible by unaided eye. The plasmodium 
      modifies its network of oscillating protoplasm in response to spatial configurations 
      of attractants and repellents, a behavior that is interpreted as biological 
      computation. To program the computing behavior of P. polycephalum, a diverse and 
      sustainable library of plasmodium modulators is required. Hairy roots produced by 
      genetic transformation with Agrobacterium rhizogenes are a metabolically stable 
      source of bioactive compounds. Adventitious roots were induced on in vitro V. 
      officinalis plants following infection with A. rhizogenes. A single hairy root clone 
      was selected for massive propagation and the biomass was characterized in P. 
      polycephalum chemotaxis, maze-solving, and electrical activity assays. The 
      Agrobacterium-derived roots of V. officinalis elicited a positive chemotactic 
      response and augmented maze-solving behavior. In a simple plasmodium circuit, 
      introduction of hairy root biomass stimulated the oscillation patterns of slime 
      mold's surface electrical activity. We propose that manipulation of P. polycephalum 
      with the plant root culture platform can be applied to the development of slime mold 
      microfluidic devices as well as future models for engineering the plant rhizosphere.

AB  - Fragments of DNA which function as autonomous replication sequences in yeast were 
      cloned from Physarum polycephalum. The ars activity is located in a 1.2 kbp fragment 
      extending 1.5 kbp to 2.7 kbp upstream of the 5' end of a histone H4 gene. Our recent 
      finding that a replication origin is located at a distance less than 3 kbp of this 
      histone gene suggests that the ars element identified coincides with a specialized 
      replication origin and can be used to direct chromosome replication in Physarum 
      polycephalum.

PG  - 901-6
AB  - The chromatin structure of Physarum polycephalum was studied with electron 
      microscope at different phases of its mitotic cycle. At the S-phase and during 
      mitosis, the chromatin has a nucleosomal structure. At the early G2-phase the 
      chromatin structure changes, long regions of non-beaded structure being found in the 
      chromatin fibers. At the late G2-phase, the major part of chromatin loses its 
      globular organization, with chromatin fibres without a pronounced subunit structure 
      prevailing in the preparations. Biochemical data show that the amount of chromatin 
      resistant to staphylococcal nuclease varies during the mitotic cycle. The amount of 
      nuclease-resistant chromatin is equal to 80% at the S-phase, to decrease up to 
      50-60% by the early G2-phase. Successive changes of chromatin structure at different 
      levels of its transcriptional activity are found. Lability of nucleosomes is shown 
      to increase with the increase in the transcriptional activity of chromatin, thus 
      leading presumably to the chromatin structural alterations during the mitotic cycle.

TI  - Electroporation of DNA into Physarum polycephalum Mitochondria: Effects on 
      Transcription and RNA Editing in Isolated Organelles.
LID - 128
AB  - Mitochondrial RNAs in the acellular slime mold Physarum polycephalum contain 
      nucleotides that are not encoded in the mitochondrial genes from which they are 
      transcribed. These site-specific changes are quite extensive, comprising ~4% of the 
      residues within mRNAs and ~2% of rRNAs and tRNAs. These "extra" nucleotides are 
      added co-transcriptionally, but the means by which this is accomplished have not 
      been elucidated. The cox1 mRNA also contains four sites of C to U changes, which 
      occur post-transcriptionally, most likely via targeted deamination. The currently 
      available in vitro systems for studying P. polycephalum editing are limited in that 
      the template is the entire ~63,000 bp mitochondrial genome. This presents a 
      significant challenge when trying to define the signals that specify editing sites. 
      In an attempt to overcome this issue, a method for introducing DNA into isolated P. 
      polycephalum mitochondria via electroporation has been developed. Exogenous DNA is 
      expressed, but the transcripts synthesized from these templates are not edited under 
      the conditions tested. However, transcripts derived from the mitochondrial genome 
      are accurately edited after electroporation, indicating that the editing machinery 
      is still functional. These findings suggest that this method may ultimately provide 
      a feasible approach to elucidating editing signals.

TI  - Pyrimidine metabolism in microplasmodia of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 417-24
AB  - If microplasmodia of Physarum polycephalum are exposed to 14C-labelled pyrimidine 
      nucleosides or bases, an unusual pattern of metabolism is found. Only the 
      nucleosides are taken up. Analysis of the distribution of the radioactivity in the 
      cells revealed that ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides are incorporated into 
      nucleotides; however, a substantial catabolism takes place. Thus incubation with 
      [2-14C]pyrimidine nucleosides readily gives rise to [14C]O2, particularly in the 
      case of [2-14C]thymidine. Due to this a significant part of the 
      trichloroacetic-acid-insoluble radioactivity from exogenously supplied 
      [2-14C]thymidine is not associated with DNA. The pattern of labelling of nucleoside 
      triphosphates from exogenously supplied nucleosides indicated that the de novo 
      synthesis of nucleotides was only partly repressed. An unusual conversion of 
      deoxycytidine into cytidine was noted. Enzyme analysis on cell-free extracts 
      revealed that pyrimidine nucleosides can be salvaged by kinases and that their 
      initial catabolism is initiated by hydrolases. Incubation of microplasmodia with 
      pyrimidine analogues showed that only nucleoside analogues are toxic. The 
      experimental results have led us to propose a scheme for the metabolism of 
      pyrimidine nucleosides and bases in Physarum polycephalum.

AB  - The chemotaxis behavior of the plasmodial stage of the true slime mold Physarum 
      Polycephalum was assessed when given a binary choice between two volatile organic 
      chemicals (VOCs) placed in its environment. All possible binary combinations were 
      tested between 19 separate VOCs selected due to their prevalence and biological 
      activity in common plant and insect species. The slime mold exhibited positive 
      chemotaxis toward a number of VOCs with the following order of preference:   
      Farnesene > β-myrcene > tridecane > limonene > p-cymene > 3-octanone > β-pinene > 
      m-cresol > benzylacetate > cis-3-hexenylacetate. For the remaining compounds, no 
      positive chemotaxis was observed in any of the experiments, and for most compounds 
      there was an inhibitory effect on the growth of the slime mold. By assessing this 
      lack of growth or failure to propagate, it was possible to produce a list of 
      compounds ranked in terms of their inhibitory effect: nonanal > benzaldehyde > 
      methylbenzoate > linalool > methyl-p-benzoquinone > eugenol > benzyl alcohol > 
      geraniol > 2-phenylethanol. This analysis shows a distinct preference of the slime 
      mold for non-oxygenated terpene and terpene-like compounds (farnesene, β-myrcene, 
      limonene, p-cymene and β-pinene). In contrast, terpene-based alcohols such as 
      geraniol and linalool were found to have a strong inhibitory effect on the slime 
      mold. Both the aldehydes utilized in this study had the strongest inhibitory effect 
      on the slime mold of all the 19 VOCs tested. Interestingly, 3-octanone, which has a 
      strong association with a "fungal odor," was the only compound with an oxygenated 
      functionality where Physarum Polycephalum exhibits distinct positive chemotaxis.

PG  - 413-20
AB  - Chromatin of lower eukaryote Physarum polycephalum, while showing typical 
      nucleosomal organization, reveals upon digestion with micrococcal nuclease certain 
      features not found in chromatins of higher eukaryotes, the most pronounced of which 
      is the unusual pattern of degradation of core-size DNA, without accumulation of 
      subcore fragments. It has been shown that these peculiarities are not due to 
      intrinsic features of Physarum nucleohistone complex but to the presence of a 
      specific polysaccharide, the main component of Physarum slime, contaminating 
      chromatin preparations.

TI  - Microbubbles in replicating nuclear deoxyribonucleic acid from Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 477-80
AB  - Clusters of microbubbles, represent probable sites of newly initiated DNA synthesis, 
      were identified in nuclear DNA from Physarum polycephalum by using the electron 
      microscope. Their presence is associated specifically with S-phase. Each microbubble 
      corresponds in size to a replicating segment of DNA about 100-5000 nucleotide 
      residues in length. The DNA structures containing microbubbles are metastable, and 
      revert to native DNA in the presence of moderate concentrations of formamide used to 
      prepare samples for electron microscopy. It is suggested that each cluster of 
      microbubbles may correspond to a unit of replication (a replicon) in Physarum DNA.

TI  - Selective suppression of positive chemotaxis in Physarum polycephalum by treatment 
      with rotenone or under anaerobic condition.
PG  - 43-7
AB  - The chemotactic motive force of plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum was measured by 
      the double-chamber method. The treatment of plasmodia with 0.1 mM rotenone did not 
      affect the motility of the palsmodia but led to suppression of the chemotaxis toward 
      all the attractants examined (glucose, galactose, c-AMP, KH2PO4). Rotenone treatment 
      did not affect the chemotaxis against repellents (fructose, NaCl). Similar results 
      were obtained when the chemotactic motive force was measured under an anaerobic 
      condition (95% N2-5% CO2).

TI  - An immunological approach to the isolation of factors with mitotic activity from the 
      plasmodial stage of the myxomycete Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 435-8
AB  - Nuclear divisions in plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum were advanced by applying 
      immunologically purified plasmodial extracts of late G2 phase on the surface of 
      plasmodia which were 1.5 h before the third mitosis. The purification of G2 extracts 
      was achieved by interaction of antibodies prepared against the antigens of early S 
      phase plasmodia with the antigens of late G2 plasmodia. There was no advancement of 
      mitosis by extracts prepared from early S phase plasmodia. Untreated G2 extracts did 
      not accelerate mitosis with the same effectiveness as did antibody purified G2 
      extracts.

PG  - 461-73
AB  - The threshold phenomena observed in chemoreception and taxis of the plasmodium of 
      Physarum polycephalum were analyzed on the basis of physical chemistry. Various 
      physicochemical concepts and rules, e.g. the Schulze-Hardy rule, the lyotropic 
      number and the hydrophobic interactions, were shown to be applicable reasonably well 
      to the physiological functions in Physarum. It was stressed that the structural 
      change of the surface membrane induced by reception of chemical stimuli plays a 
      decisive role in recognition and sensitivity to the external stimuli as well as the 
      appearance of tactic movement in the amoeboid motility of Physarum.

TI  - Subunit structure of chromosomes in mitotic nuclei of physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 95-102
AB  - We have investigated the subunit structure of mitotic chromosomes of the acellular 
      slime mould Physarum polycephalum, using the nuclease susceptibility of isolated 
      mitotic nuclei as a probe. A characteristic pattern of DNA digestion products is 
      obtained, containing approximately integral multiples of a basic 140 base pair DNA 
      segment that resembles very closely the pattern in G2 phase nuclei of Physarum and 
      of calf lymphocyte nuclei. These results demonstrate that during the process of 
      chromosome condensation there is no alteration at the primary level of chromatin 
      structure that is responsible for the characteristic DNA digestion pattern.

      functional states of nuclei of a ciliate Bursaria truncatella and a myxomycete 
      Physarum polycephalum].
PG  - 87-97
AB  - Chromatin structural organization was studied by means of electron microscopy in the 
      macronuclei of ciliate Bursaria truncatella at various stages of the life cycle (at 
      different time intervals after cell division, in resting cysts and at excysting) and 
      in the nuclei of myxomycete Physarum polycephalum during the mitotic cycle. Inactive 
      chromatin was shown to be organized in compact clumps 100-300 nm in diameter linked 
      with each other, their loop organization being convincingly demonstrated. Upon 
      activation chromatin decompacts and is represented by nucleosomal fibres with a lot 
      of replicationally and transcriptionally active regions. Both the reptication and 
      transcription processes in physarum nuclei and transcription processes in bursaria 
      can occur on the loops of chromatin fibres emerging from the decompacting clump. The 
      data obtained evidence in favour of a structural-functional correspondence between 
      the chromatin clumps of physarum and bursaria and the chromomeres in chromosomes of 
      higher eucaryotes. Based on the data received it is concluded that the chromatin 
      clump represents a dynamic structure unit able to decompact forming the loop-shaped 
      chromatin fibres. Such a structural organization provides the spacial distribution 
      of DNA in the nuclei and the possibility of selective functioning of definite 
      regions of the genome.

AB  - We analyzed the cellular contents of not only major polyamines but also minor

      molds as major polyamines was confirmed. In addition to these polyamines, 
      appreciable amounts of 1,3-diaminopropane were detected in P. polycephalum and D. 
      discoideum. Cadaverine and sym-homospermidine were detected in P. polycephalum even 
      when the slime mold was cultured in a chemically defined growth medium. Spermine was 
      not detected when these molds were grown in synthetic media. Other "unusual" 
      polyamines such as norspermidine, norspermine, thermospermine, 
      aminopropylcadaverine, and canavalmine were not detected in either mold.

TI  - [Influence of cultivation temperature on the development of functionally active 
      photoregulatory systems in cells of Neurospora crassa and Physarum polycephalum].
PG  - 156-61
AB  - Illumination with a visible light is known to induce accumulation of colored 
      carotenoid pigments in mycelial cells on Neurospora crassa and sporulation of 
      starved macroplasmodia of Physarum polycephalum. In both microorganisms, the 
      temperature, at which they are cultivated in the dark, controls manifestation of the 
      photoregulation processes in the cells subsequently exposed to light. The maximal 
      rate of photoinduced accumulation of carotenoids in N. crassa is observed, when the 
      cells are grown in the dark at 25-28 degrees C; the highest photoinduction of P. 
      polycephalum sporulation takes place, if microplasmodia are grown in the dark at 
      21-23 degrees C and macroplasmodia are starved at no more than 23 degrees C. Both a 
      5 degree C rise and fall of the temperature of dark cultivation from the optimum 
      dramatically inhibits the cell ability for photoresponse. This inhibition is not 
      associated with suppression of cell growth processes: temperature rise at the dark 
      period up to 32 degrees C for N. crassa and 25-27 degrees C for P. polycephalum 
      brings the subsequent photoresponse to a minimum but does not produce any negative 
      effect on the growth rate. It is concluded that temperature affects specifically 
      processes of formation of functionally active photoregulatory systems.

AB  - The release of DNAs from nuclear preparations isolated at different steps of the

      UV-light for 5 min (lambda 253.7 A, i = 1.8 . 10(2) j . m-2 . min-1) into 1% Na-DS - 
      1.5 M NaCl solution was studied. The value obtained correlated well with the degree 
      of binding of interacting proteins with DNA in chromatin and was identical for all 
      the preparations tested with the only exception of the nuclei isolated at the end of 
      the S-phase, when a slight but significant (15 +/- 10%) increase in DNA release was 
      observed. The results obtained are discussed in terms of structural transitions and 
      function of chromatin during the cell cycle of the myxomycete Physarum polycephalum.

TI  - Substrate specificity and mode of action of the zinc-metallo nuclease from Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 1655-61
AB  - The alkaline zinc-metallo nuclease of Physarum polycephalum is an endonuclease with 
      a high specificity for single-stranded nucleic acids. Single-stranded DNA was 
      cleaved at least 6,000 times faster than double-stranded DNA under identical 
      conditions. In the supercoil-induced single-stranded region of Form I PM2 DNA only a 
      single nick was made. The nuclease showed nucleotide specificity. Poly(A), poly(I), 
      and poly(dT) were preferentially hydrolyzed. Product analysis showed that it acted 
      by an endonucleolytic mechanism: long polynucleotides were fragmented via 
      intermediate length products to oligo- and mono-nucleotides with the phosphate group 
      at the 5'-terminal position. Extensive similarities exist with the 
      single-strand-specific nuclease S1 from Aspergillus. The zinc-metallo endonuclease 
      from Physarum could be used as a similar probe for single-stranded nucleic acids at 
      neutral or alkaline pH conditions.

TI  - Growth and migration of plasmodia of the myxomycete Physarum polycephalum: the 
      effect of carbohydrates, including agar.
PG  - 9-15
AB  - A method for studying the growth and migration of myxomycete plasmodia on the 
      surface of agar and other gels was devised. The migration rate of plasmodia of 
      Physarum polycephalum was greatly reduced when nutrients that permit rapid growth 
      were present, and slightly reduced by most sugars tested at 56 mM, including some 
      that were not utilized. The carbohydrate requirement of the myxomycete could be 
      satisfied by a range of sugars and derivatives, including mannitol and agar, 
      utilization of the latter being slight but definite. Fructose could be utilized as 
      long as it was not the sole carbohydrate present.

PG  - 321-30
AB  - Results obtained by three different electrophysiological methods delivered mainly 
      oscillating potentials (independently of the type of organization of Physarum 
      polycephalum) with an average period length of 1 min 21 sec. This value is in good 
      statistical agreement with corresponding data for the periodical oscillation of the 
      shuttle streaming (1 min 47 sec) and coincides also with the radial tensiometric 
      contractile activity (1 min 34 sec). The investigation favours the hypothesis that 
      ion fluxes across the cell membrane and perhaps between intracellular compartments 
      may act as a trigger mechanism for a still unknown oscillator-system which controls 
      cell movement phenomena in the acellular slime molds.

AB  - The histones of Physarum polycephalum have been isolated and fractionated using a

      precipitation. The four core histones were unambiguously identified by gel 
      electrophoresis, amino acid composition and N-terminal analysis. The molecular 
      weight of Physarum histones H3, H2B and H4 are very close or identical to the 
      corresponding histones from chicken erythrocytes. Physarum H2A is significantly 
      larger than chicken erythrocyte H2A and its N-terminal residue is alanine. From the 
      differences in amino acid compositions and in the peptide maps between Physarum and 
      calf H4, one can expected some changes in the amino acid sequence of Physarum H4.

LID - 10.4137/GRSB.S10224 [doi]
AB  - Physarum polycephalum is a unicellular eukaryote belonging to the amoebozoa group of 
      organisms. The complex life cycle involves various cell types that differ in 
      morphology, function, and biochemical composition. Sporulation, one step in the life 
      cycle, is a stimulus-controlled differentiation response of macroscopic plasmodial 
      cells that develop into fruiting bodies. Well-established Mendelian genetics and the 
      occurrence of macroscopic cells with a naturally synchronous population of nuclei as 
      source of homogeneous cell material for biochemical analyses make Physarum an 
      attractive model organism for studying the regulatory control of cell 
      differentiation. Here, we develop an approach using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), 
      without needing to rely on a genome sequence as a reference, for studying the 
      transcriptomic changes during stimulus-triggered commitment to sporulation in 
      individual plasmodial cells. The approach is validated through the obtained 
      expression patterns and annotations, and particularly the results from up- and 
      downregulated genes, which correlate well with previous studies.

TI  - Ultrastructural localization of beta-D-galactan in the nuclei of the myxomycete 
      Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 308-14
AB  - The acellular slime mold Physarum polycephalum produces an extracellular sulfated 
      and phosphorylated beta-D-galactan which was recently isolated from the nuclei of 
      this organism. This polysaccharide has now been localized in the nuclei of P. 
      polycephalum by electron microscopy using a specific "sandwich" technique: thin 
      sections of P. polycephalum microplasmodia were incubated with the Ricinus communis 
      lectin specific for D-galactose residues. The bound lectin was then localized with 
      gold granules labeled with a galactose-terminated glycoprotein (desialylated 
      ceruloplasmin). The galactan was found in the nuclei mainly associated with 
      chromatin and, also, but to a smaller extent, in the cytoplasm and in some vacuoles. 
      The specificity of the method was assessed by marking under the same condition the 
      galactomannan present in the cell wall of the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.

TI  - An immunological approach to enrich a mitotic stimulator and to reveal 
      G2-phase-specific proteins in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 1930-3
AB  - Purified antibodies from an antiserum against S-phase proteins of the myxomycete 
      Physarum polycephalum were attached to protein-A-Sepharose CL-4B. A late G2-phase 
      extract that contained a mitosis-stimulating protein was applied to this 
      immunoadsorbent, and the mitosis-stimulating protein was enriched by a factor of 
      ten. This protein, which is present in the cell in low amounts, is synthesized in 
      late G2 phase and obviously degraded in a later stage of the cycle. Immunoadsorption 
      of a G2-phase extract with anti-S-antibodies decreased the 700 main proteins to 20 
      as demonstrated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. No difference in protein 
      pattern could be observed on two-dimensional gels between S-phase and G2-phase 
      extracts before and after immunoadsorption with anti-S-antibodies. This indicates 
      that there are no G2-phase-specific proteins among the 700 most abundant proteins of 
      Physarum polycephalum.

      DEAE-cellulose chromatography have been characterized. The enzyme variants show 
      similar catalytic properties (e.g., substrate specificity, pH optimum) and molecular 
      weights, as judges by their sedimentation in sucrose gradients. However, they differ 
      significantly with respect to pI, inhibition by dTTP and thermostability, and they 
      have slightly different Km values for deoxythymidine as a substrate.

      strands of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 151-60
AB  - Rhythmicity of contraction of plasmodial strands of Physarum polycephalum was 
      studied, by measuring the isometric tension exerted by isolated segments of the 
      strands. When 2 strands were connected by way of a plasmodial mass, the 
      contraction-relaxation cycle of the 2 strands synchronized. Such cycle activity of 
      the strand was found to be well coordinated with shuttle streaming in the plasmodial 
      mass which had been in connection with the strand. The presence of a control system 
      which induces synchrony of periodic activity over the entire body of a plasmodium is 
      discussed.

TI  - Sterol content of the Myxomycetes Physarum polycephalum and P. flavicomum.
PG  - 565-71
AB  - The sterol content of two Myxomycetes, Physarum polycephalum and P. flavicomum has 
      been examined. The sterols of the two species are apparently identical, the two 
      major sterols in each being poriferasterol and 22-dihydroporiferasterol. Threee 
      minor sterols are probably delta5-ergostenol, ergostanol, and poriferastanol. The 
      triterpenoids of the two species differ in that, though lanosterol was identified in 
      both, 22-dihydrolanosterol was indicated only in P. flavicomum. The occurrence of 
      lanosterol together with a typical mixture of plant sterols is somewhat unusual.

PG  - 135-43
AB  - We have investigated the transcription of ribosomal RNA in plasmodia of Physarum 
      polycephalum by a combination of pulse-labelling with [3H]uridine and RNA:DNA 
      hybridization. The DNA used for the hybridization was a HindIII restriction fragment 
      (cloned in bacteriophage lambda) of Physarum ribosomal DNA that carries a 
      substantial fraction of the rRNA genes, enabling the ribosomal transcripts in the 
      newly synthesized RNA to be measured. We found that ribosomal RNA constituted about 
      40% of the pulse-labelled RNA at all times during the synchronous mitotic cycle.

AB  - The tubulins of the plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum have been identified by in 
      vitro microtubule assembly from partially purified extracts of asynchronous 
      microplasmodia and late G2 macroplasmodia. The plasmodial tubulin group comprised of 
      2 alpha tubulins (app. m.w. 51000 daltons) and 2 beta tubulins (app. m.w. 58000 
      daltons and 55000 daltons) and appeared to be identical with a group of polypeptides 
      which are synthesized periodically in late G2. Two of the plasmodial tubulin 
      subunits (one alpha and one beta) were identical to the Physarum amoebal tubulin 
      alpha and beta subunits as characterised by 2D gel positions.

TI  - Cell-cycle-specific activity of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase in Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 159-68
AB  - The cell-cycle-related activities of the cAMP- and cGMP-dependent phosphodiesterases 
      of Physarum polycephalum were assayed. The activities of plasmodial homogenate and 
      of selected subcellular fractions were measured. The results suggested the presence 
      of both cAMP- and cGMP-dependent phosphodiesterase in the isolated nuclei of P. 
      polycephalum. In addition, they reveal that the cAMP- and cGMP-dependent 
      phosphodiesterase activities of the subcellular fractions fluctuate throughout the 
      cell cycle. The whole-cell homogenates exhibit no cell-cycle-related changes in the 
      presence of 5 X 10(-4) M cGMP. Kinetic data suggest the presence of multiple 
      phosphodiesterase activities in the homogenate and its particulate fractions for the 
      cGMP-dependent enzyme. Multiple cAMP activities are also suggested for the 
      particulate fractions. The Km values indicate that the substrate affinities of the 
      phosphodiesterases from P. polycephalum are similar to those found previously in 
      mammalian systems.

AB  - The 7-14S poly A- RNA isolated from the S-state polysomes of the macroplasmodium P. 
      polycephalum reveals the properties of histone mRNA. In the wheat germ cell-free 
      system this RNA is translated into the polypeptides with the same electrophoretic 
      mobility as core histones of P. polycephalum. Using centrifugation in a CsCl density 
      gradient with actinomycin D, a DNA fraction was isolated which hybridizes with cDNA 
      synthesized at 7-14S poly A- RNA by reverse transcription with random priming. The 
      DNA fraction formed can be used for cloning of P. polycephalum histone genes.

      amplitude of the oscillation, but stayed constant above a critical value. The above 
      empirical formulae were found applicable for all temperatures employed, 9 to 28 
      degrees C, but different temperature coefficients were observed below and above 15 
      to 16 degrees C.

      measured during the synchronous mitotic cycle of the slime mould Physarum 
      polycephalum. The most pronounced fluctuation of the deoxyribonucleoside 
      triphosphates was seen shortly before and after initiation of DNA synthesis. The 
      pools of dTTP, dATP, dCTP and dGTP expanded before initiation of DNA synthesis and 
      decreased again in early S phase. The pools of ribonucleoside triphosphates 
      increased during mitosis and again 1 h after mitosis and 5 h after mitosis.

TI  - [Comparative enzymatic study on the structure of chromatin in the nuclei of the 
      growing microplasmodium of Physarum polycephalum].
PG  - 1392-400
AB  - The structure of chromatin in the growing myxomycetes P. polycephalum can be 
      interpreted on the basis of three types of substructure: (i) soluble in a low ionic 
      strength buffer and 2 mM EDTA (I), (ii) soluble in 0.6 M NaCl (II) and (iii) 
      non-soluble and nuclease-insensitive (III). The ratio of these structures in the 
      nuclear pellet obtained after autolysis was found to be 71 : 0, 4 : 12 for the young 
      and 7.7 : 62 : 20.6 for the old cultures, respectively. The ageing of the culture 
      involves transition of substructure I to substructure II. The substructures differ 
      in the nuclease sensitivity. The specific features of enzyme fragmentation of 
      chromatin from P. polycephalum microplasmodium nuclei are discussed.

TI  - The effect of alfalfa saponins on growth and lysis of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 77-81
AB  - The prelytic events associated with the interaction of saponins with Physarum 
      polycephalum membrane components were studied. It was found that alfalfa saponins 
      form interaction products with membranal sterols, proteins and phospholipids. The 
      interaction of saponins with proteins affect also certain membranal enzymic 
      activities such as NADH oxidase and Malate dehydrogenase. It is suggested that 
      although the interaction of the saponin with sterols is much more specific than with 
      other membranal components, the lysis of plasmodia of P. polycephalum should be 
      attributed to a concerted attack on the various membrane constituents. In 
      continuation of these interactions, the changes of permeability of plasmodia 
      membrane were expressed by increment of inorganic sodium ions and water influx, 
      traced by lysis, while no efflux of ions was observed.

AB  - This paper proposes a hybrid swarming algorithm based on Ant Colony Optimization and 
      Physarum Polycephalum Algorithm. And the Van Der Waals force is first applied to the 
      pheromone update mechanism of the hybrid algorithm. The improved method can prevent 
      premature convergence into the local optimal solution. Simulation results show the 
      proposed approach has excellent in solving accuracy and convergence time. We also 
      compare the improved algorithm with other advanced algorithms and the results show 
      that our algorithm is more accurate than the literature algorithms. In addition, we 
      use the capitals of 35 Asian countries as an example to verify the robustness and 
      versatility of the hybrid algorithm.

TI  - Degradation of bacterial lipopolysaccharide by the slime mould Physarum

PG  - 124-9
AB  - A strain of the acellular slime mould Physarum polycephalum degraded 
      lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from a variety of bacteria. The anticomplementary (AC) 
      activity of LPS was greatly reduced, as was the content of lauric, myristic, and 
      palmitic acids, and the ability to sensitize erythrocytes to agglutination by 
      antibody. These results indicate that Physarum has enzymes which reduce the lipid A 
      moiety of LPS. In contrast, 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-manno-actanoic acid (KDO), 
      immunodominant sugars, and beta-hydroxymyristic acid were scarcely affected. Both 
      supernates and plasmodial extracts of Physarum had LPS-degradative activity and were 
      able to attack both purified LPS and LPS in killed bacteria.

AB  - Asynchronous amoebal cultures of temperature-sensitive mutants of Physarum 
      polycephalum were examined cytologically, and two cell cycle mutants were 
      identified. Genetic analysis indicated that each mutant carried a single mutation 
      that was expressed in both amoebal and plasmodial phases. Thus it is possible to 
      isolate cell cycle mutations expressed in plasmodia by initial isolation and 
      analysis of amoebal mutants, a quicker procedure than the alternative of isolating 
      plasmodial mutants directly. The two mutants were studied further by measuring 
      nuclear DNA contents and synthesis of macromolecules. Both mutants gave results 
      consistent with a block in nuclear division.

      polycephalum and Physarum nudum.
PG  - 178-83
AB  - Plasmodia of the true slime molds Physarum polycephalum and Physarum nudum were 
      grown on agar semidefined medium (J. W. Daniel and H. Baldwin (1964) in Methods in 
      Cell Physiology (Precsott, D. M., Ed.), Vol. 1, pp. 9-44, Academic Press, New York.) 
      and pigments were extracted from 8-day-old plasmodia with the same solvent mixture 
      that was used later as a mobile phase in the HPLC analysis. The separation was 
      carried out on a strong anion exchanger column in a methanol/borate buffer solution. 
      Under these conditions eight pigments from P. polycephalum and eight from P. nudum 
      were revealed. This method can be used for detailed studies of plasmodial pigments 
      in these species.

PG  - 21-4
AB  - ADP-ribosyltransferase was measured in isolated nuclei of Physarum polycephalum. 
      Activity was determined with and without exogenous DNA and histones. During the 
      synchronous cell cycle the activity measured with exogenous substrates exhibited a 
      typical peak enzyme pattern with a maximum of activity in S-phase, whereas activity 
      measured without exogenous substrates displayed a step enzyme pattern. Both 
      activities doubled in each cell cycle.

TI  - Multiple effects of 5 mM sodium butyrate on Physarum polycephalum macroplasmodia.
PG  - 195-200
AB  - In a Physarum polycephalum macroplasmodium, nuclei naturally divide synchronously. 
      Thus, it offers an opportunity to study growth and mitosis within a true organism. 
      The effects of 5 mM sodium-butyrate on these processes have been examined. When this 
      material is added to the culture medium during mitosis, the butyrate acts like a 
      fixative on condensed chromosomes. During interphase, this short fatty acid stops 
      growth and immediately inhibits DNA synthesis. Furthermore, it prevents 
      differentiation in macroplasmodia induced to spherulate. All these modifications are 
      readily reversible after transfer to a medium lacking butyrate.

TI  - The uptake and metabolism of uridine by the slime mould Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 257-63
AB  - 1. Uridine is taken up by microplasmodia of Physarum polycephalum via a saturatable 
      transport system with an apparent Km of 29 muM. An intracellular concentration 
      significantly higher than that in the growth medium is attained, suggesting that the 
      uptake is an active process. Both deoxyribonucleosides and ribonucleosides are 
      competitive inhibitors of the uptake of uridine. 2. In contrast, the rate of entry 
      of uridine into surface plasmodia is a linear function of the concentration of the 
      nucleoside in the growth medium, and the uptake is not inhibited by other 
      nucleosides. 3. As well as serving as a source of pyrimidine nucleotides for the 
      synthesis of nucleic acids, uridine is also catabolised by P. polycephalum. Uracil 
      accumulates in the growth medium and there is also significant conversion of C-2 of 
      the pyrimidine ring to CO2. The proportion of uridine subject to catabolism in 
      surface plasmodia is less than that observed for microplasmodia.

TI  - Transcriptionally active chromatin can be selectively released by DNase I from 
      Physarum polycephalum genome.
PG  - 191-8
AB  - In a simple eukaryote Physarum polycephalum about 13% of the genome is transcribed 
      into abundant cytoplasmic RNA as shown by S1 nuclease digestion of DNA-RNA hybrids. 
      Mild digestion of isolated Physarum nuclei with DNase I liberates a fraction of 
      chromatin 3.5-fold enriched in sequences hybridizing by Physarum poly(A)+ RNA. This 
      fraction is similarly enriched in histone H4 and actin genes known to be actively 
      transcribed in Physarum. High content (about 45%) of actively transcribed sequences 
      in DNase-I-released fraction of Physarum chromatin makes it particularly well suited 
      for studying the structural basis of transcriptional activation in eukaryotes.

TI  - Ribosomal genes in Physarum polycephalum: transcribed and non-transcribed sequences 
      have similar base compositions.
PG  - 599-605
AB  - The transcribed and non-transcribed sequences in Physarum polycephalum ribosomal DNA 
      (rDNA) were separated by restriction nuclease digestion of pure rDNA and the 
      products fractionated by zone sedimentation in sucrose gradients. The base 
      compositions of the fragments were determined by analytical centrifugation in CsCl 
      or in CsCl with netropsin. All the fragments had dA + dT contents in the range 
      44-48%. From the known sequence arrangement and transcription pattern of Physarum 
      rDNA it was concluded that coding sequences, transcribed but non-coding sequences, 
      and non-transcribed sequences all possess similar base compositions, contrary to the 
      situation in many other systems. The thermal denaturation profile of Physarum rDNA 
      is reported. It suggests the rDNA sequence is complex and supports the above 
      conclusion of limited heterogeneity of base composition.

TI  - Distribution and dynamics of fluorochromed actin in living stages of Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 235-45
AB  - Isolated muscle and Physarum actins were labeled with various fluorochromes and 
      microinjected into living stages of Physarum polycephalum (caffeine-droplets, 
      endoplasmic drops, thin-spread macroplasmodia). Subsequent analysis of the 
      intracellular redistribution by fluorescence microscopy, video-enhancement and 
      digital image processing revealed RITC (rhodamineisothiocyanate) actin to be the 
      most reliable molecular probe for the marking of microfilaments. In relaxed 
      caffeine-droplets, the RITC-actin first diffuses randomly and then is locally 
      incorporated into a thin cortical layer at the internal face of the plasma membrane. 
      During Ca2+-induced contraction the fluorescent layer starts to detach from the 
      plasma membrane, thus causing separation of central granuloplasm from peripheral 
      hyaloplasm. Thin sections of both, relaxed and contracted specimens demonstrated 
      that the RITC-actin layer in living droplets exactly coincides with a sheath of more 
      or less oriented microfilaments. In contrast, RITC-bovine serum albumin (BSA) 
      injected as control is excluded from those regions which show intense fluorescence 
      with RITC-actin and the presence of an actin network with EM. Successful 
      incorporation of the molecular probe into stages of Physarum polycephalum other than 
      caffeine droplets was not yet achieved. The results obtained by fluorescent analog 
      cytochemistry (FAC) are discussed with regard to the spatial organization of the 
      actin system in acellular slime molds.

AB  - An examination of the foldback fraction of nuclear DNA from Physarum polycephalum 
      has been carried out using the electron microscope. Results show that the inverted 
      repeat sequences responsible for the formation of foldback DNA range from 150-3000 
      bases in length, with a number-average size of 340 bases. About one-half of the 
      inverted sequences form looped structures with loop sizes averaging 1200 bases in 
      length. The distance between adjacent foldback sequences is estimated to be in the 
      range 100-1500 bases.

TI  - Growth and differentiation of wild type amoebae of Physarum polycephalum in liquid 
      culture.
PG  - 229-38
AB  - A method for growing wild type amoebal strains of Physarum polycephalum in 
      two-membered liquid culture is presented. The medium is a simple buffered salts 
      solution. We found that a minimal level of divalent cation was required for growth. 
      All amoebal strains tried to date have grown under our conditions in stationary 
      culture. Growth under gyratory conditions was only successful at 60 rpm or less and 
      consistent growth required a period of adaptation over several transfers. 
      Differentiation of two apogamic strains, CL and CH1, were compared. Contrary to the 
      results seen on agar plates, the time of onset for the first committed amoebae was 
      identical for both strains in liquid culture. Attempts to demonstrate mating between 
      two genetically compatible amoebal strains grown together in liquid culture were not 
      successful.

TI  - A correlation between in vivo and in vitro effects of the microtubule inhibitors 
      colchicine, parbendazole and nocodazole on myxamoebae of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 1-6
AB  - The effects of the microtubule inhibitors colchicine, parbendazole and nocodazole on 
      the growth of myxamoebae of Physarum polycephalum were closely paralleled by the 
      effects of these drugs on the assembly in vitro of purified amoebal microtubule 
      protein. Colchicine at 100 microM did not inhibit amoebal growth and did not inhibit 
      formation, or depolymerization, of amoebal microtubules. The benzimidazole carbamate 
      derivatives nocodazole and parbendazole were very effective in both inhibiting 
      growth and inhibiting the assembly in vitro of amoebal microtubule protein. 
      Parbendazole was the most effective.

PG  - 305-16
AB  - After an initial decrease, the specific activity of Physarum polycephalum acid 
      phosphomonoesterase increases during the growth of the organism in an axenic medium. 
      This increase is independent of the inorganic phosphate concentration in the culture 
      medium. The specific activity of inorganic alkaline pyrophosphatase remains constant 
      during the growth and is not modified by a high extracellular concentration of 
      orthophosphate. During starvation in a non nutritive saline medium, the increase of 
      acid phosphatase activity is immediate whereas pyrophosphatase activity remnins 
      constant.

PG  - 257-60
AB  - The lethal reaction following fusion of plasmodia of a sensitive and a killer strain 
      of Physarum polycephalum could be prevented by the incorporation of 
      5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine in both strains. This result suggests the involvement of 
      transcription in the lethal reaction. Although under appropriate conditions fusion 
      of the strains is not followed by a lethal reaction the fused plasmodium will behave 
      as the killer strain after subculturing. At different times after fusion, DNA was 
      isolated from a plasmodium in which visible lethal reaction was prevented and 
      separated on CsCl gradients. Killer DNA remained intact but sensitive DNA was broken 
      down, mainly from 8--11 h after fusion.

PG  - 379-84
AB  - The rate of NAD turnover in microplasmodia of Physarum polycephalum was investigated 
      using a double labeling technique with (14C)-adenine or adenosine and 
      (3H)-nicotinamide. The half-life of an NAD molecule in Physarum was estimated to be 
      25 min, which is shorter than in either E. coli or human cell lines. The half-life 
      of NAD in the presence of an inhibitor of NADase and poly ADPR synthase, 
      5-methylnicotinamide, was also investigated, but found to be indistinguishable from 
      controls. The possible reasons for this and for the rapid turnover is discussed in 
      the light of the known functions for NAD in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

TI  - Synthesis of transfer RNA during the synchronous nuclear division cycle in Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 93-6
AB  - 1. The synthesis of tRNA during the synchronous nuclear division cycle in plasmodia 
      of Physarum polycephalum has been investigated using an isotope dilution procedure 
      and compared to the pattern of synthesis of rRNA. 2. The synthesis of both tRNA 
      stops during mitosis. As the genes for the two types of RNA are not linked, this 
      finding suggests that cessation of synthesis during nuclear division is a common 
      characteristic of all types of transcription, supporting earlier work using pulse 
      labelling and autoradiography to investigate the same problem.

TI  - Phosphohistidine is found in basic nuclear proteins of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 151-4
AB  - Nuclear extracts of the true slime mold, Physarum polycephalum, show protein 
      histidine kinase activity towards exogenous histones [(1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 
      16106-16113]. Physarum microplasmodia were labeled with [32P]phosphate in vivo and 
      two basic proteins containing alkali-stable phosphate were detected. The labeled 
      proteins comigrated with Physarum histones H1 (approximately) and H2A and 
      phosphoamino acid analysis showed that each protein contained 
      [32P]-phosphohistidine. The H2A-like protein was also labeled in isolated nuclei 
      incubated with [35S]thio-ATP. We conclude that some Physarum nuclear proteins 
      contain phosphohistidine.

TI  - Structure of a beta-galactan isolated from the nuclei of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 37-40
AB  - A sulfated and phosphorylated beta-D-galactan ([alpha]D+8degrees) was isolated from 
      the nuclei of the acellular slime mould Physarum polycephalum. The polysaccharide 
      was isolated from cesium chloride gradients during the preparation of ribosomal DNA 
      and purified. The purified galactan contained 89% galactose, 2.5% phosphate and 9.6% 
      sulfate groups and had an average degree of polymerisation of 560. Periodate 
      degradation and permethylation studies indicated the presence of mainly (1 leads to 
      4)-, but also of (1 leads to 3)-, and (1 leads to 6)-linked galactose units with one 
      branch every 13 units. These results suggested that the intranuclear galactan, apart 
      from its higher sulfate content, is similar to the extracellular polysaccharide 
      produced by P. polycephalum.

TI  - Changes in intracellular pH accompanying chemoreception in the plasmodia of Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 2647-51
AB  - A new method for measuring intracellular pH, employing the intrinsic fluorescent 
      pigments of the plasmodia of the myxomycete Physarum polycephalum, was used to study 
      the role of pH in chemotactic transduction in the plasmodia. The cell became 
      acidified following stimulation with the attractants alanine, glucose, galactose and 
      maltose when their concentrations exceeded the respective thresholds of 
      chemoreception and taxis. The degree of cell acidification paralleled the relaxing 
      tendency in tension generation. A non-metabolizable attractant, 2-deoxyglucose, also 
      acidified the cell. However, the repellent salts NaCl, KCl and CaCl2 did not change 
      the intracellular pH. Our results suggest that the effects of attractants are 
      mediated by intracellular pH, while the effects of repellents are transduced by ATP 
      as reported previously.

TI  - Utilization of polyadenylate mRNA during growth and starvation in Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 413-20
AB  - The effect of growth on the efficiency of utilization of poly(A)-containing mRNA for 
      translation has been investigated in microplasmodia of Physarum polycephalum. 
      Measurement of the relative proportions of poly(A)-rich mRNA in polysomal and 
      post-polysomal fractions isolated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation reveals 
      that newly synthesized poly(A)-rich mRNA is present in increasing proportions in the 
      polysomal region during exponential growth. However, the proportion of long-lived 
      poly(A)-rich mRNA observed in actively-translating polysomes declines as starvation 
      approaches. The ribonuclease content and morphology of the microplasmodia were 
      monitored during growth and starvation in an effort to related this phenomenon to 
      the onset of spherulation.

TI  - Electron microscopic and microprobe analysis of calciuminduced differentiation of 
      the white mutant (LU887 x LU897) strain of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 495-505
AB  - Differentiation of the white mutant (LU887 x LU897) strain of Physarum polycephalum 
      leading to spherule formation can be induced by CaCl(2) if the concentration in the 
      nutrient medium is increased by 5mM prior to the transfer to a non-nutrient salts 
      medium. All stages previously reported for the typical (M(3)cVII) strain of Physarum 
      polycephalum from microplasmodia to spherules are seen but the mutant lacks the 
      synchrony that the replacement technique induces in the typical strain. X-ray 
      microanalyses locate calcium and phosphorus in granules in mitochondria and in the 
      cytoplasm of specimens fixed without osmium. Mitochondria accumulate 
      calcium-containing granules during early differentiation and appear to be 
      essentially without granules in mature spherules. Mobilization of mitochondrial 
      calcium is implicated in the initiation of differentiation. A longitudinally 
      striated cytoplasmic inclusion is abundant in microplasmodia grown in media that 
      have not been supplemented with additional calcium and is seen more rarely during 
      calcium-induced spherulation. Whether or not this inclusion represents cytoplasmic 
      contractile elements is unknown. The calcium-treated mutant strain, previously 
      considered non-differentiating, may prove to be a good alternate model for the study 
      of factors influencing differentiation. It was employed earlier as a control in 
      studies of strains that readily spherulate in response to routine procedures.

TI  - Synthesis and transport of myosin in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 43-50
AB  - Immunological techniques have been used to study the rate of synthesis and 
      intracellular transport of myosin in the slime mould Physarum polycephalum. 
      Quantitative precipitation of myosin in homogenates of Physarum was achieved using 
      an antimyosin antibody produced in rabbit in response to purified Physarum myosin. 
      Dodecylsulphate-gel electrophoresis revealed that about 50% of the precipitated 
      material is myosin. The rates of synthesis of total cellular protein and myosin were 
      measured over the mitotic cycle. Both were found to increase exponentially or 
      linearly between two successive nuclear divisions. Similarly, no difference in the 
      proportion of myosin-synthesising polysomes, assayed by precipitation with 
      antimyosin serum, could be detected between the S phase and G2 phase of the mitotic 
      cycle. Myosin makes up nearly 2% of total plasmodial proteins. Its transport into 
      the nucleus occurs predominantly during the G2 phase.

TI  - Nuclear polyphosphate as a possible source of energy during the sporulation of 
      Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 215-23
AB  - 31P NMR spectroscopic analysis of the polyphosphate pool in cellular and nuclear 
      extracts of Physarum polycephalum demonstrates that plasmodia and cysts contain 
      inorganic polyphosphates with an average chain length of about 100 phosphates. 
      However, only during sporulation are these high-molecular-weight polyphosphates 
      degraded to a lower molecular weight corresponding to an average chain length of 
      about 10 phosphates. Since polyphosphates are degraded even in the presence of a 
      sufficiently large pool of inorganic phosphate, produced by intracellular injection, 
      we conclude that the degradation of polyphosphates serves in supplying energy for 
      biosynthesis during sporulation rather than in increasing the availability of 
      phosphate.

TI  - Degradation of the ribosomal genes by DNAse I in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 391-5
AB  - Treatment of nuclei from Physarum polycephalum with DNAse I leads to DNA fragments 
      with a regular pattern of multiples of 10 nucleotides, when analyzed on gels under 
      denaturing conditions as has been shown for other eukaryotes. Reports from Weintraub 
      and Axel lead to the conclusion, that active genes are preferentially digested by 
      DNAse I. When Physarum chromatin is degraded by DNAse I, the ribosomal genes are no 
      longer available for hybridization with 19-S and 26-S rRNA and are thus 
      preferentially destroyed. Degradation of chromatin from nuclei in mitosis, where no 
      rRNA is synthesized and from nuclei in late G2 phase, where rRNA synthesis is 
      maximal, leads to the same proportion of the ribosomal sequences being lost for 
      hybridization. Therefore the preferential degradation of the ribosomal genes in 
      Physarum by DNAse I probably does not reflect the actual momentary activity of these 
      genes. This suggests that DNAse I treatment may distinguish between active chromatin 
      and very strongly repressed chromatin.

PG  - 3896-9
AB  - An extract of small molecules (molecular weight less than 500) of the slime mold 
      Physarum polycephalum undergoes a shift in ultraviolet-visible absorption spectrum 
      upon illumination. This illumination also confers on the extract the ability to 
      induce sporulation when injected into a starved, unilluminated slime mold. The 
      spectral shift and appearance of the sporulation-inducing activity both occur 
      regardless of whether the illumination is carried out on an intact slime mold or on 
      the plasmodium-free extract itself. Thin-layer chromatography resolves the slime 
      mold extract into four major visible fractions. One of these has high 
      sporulation-inducing activity after illumination in vitro.

AB  - The specific activity of uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine-4-epimerase 
      increases during spherulation of Physarum polycephalum, a process that involves the 
      synthesis of galactosamine walls. This increase is prevented by the addition of 
      cycloheximide.

AB  - We have investigated the occurrence of protein-fatty acid acylation by metabolic 
      incorporation of [3H]myristic and [3H]palmitic acids in Physarum polycephalum. We 
      show that this organism contains fatty acylated proteins with mainly myristic acid 
      covalently attached in alkali-stable linkages, probably amides. We find no evidence 
      for ester-linked fatty acids, in contrast to the situation in vertebrate cells.

TI  - Demonstration of different patterns of microtubule organization in Physarum 
      polycephalum myxamoebae and plasmodia using immunofluorescence microscopy.
PG  - 67-74
AB  - We have used anti-tubulin antibodies and immunofluorescence microscopy to determine 
      the overall distribution of microtubules during interphase and mitosis in both the 
      myxamoebae and plasmodia of the slime mold Physarum polycephalum. We have paralleled 
      these observations with electron microscopy of the same stages. The myxamoebae 
      possess a network of cytoplasmic microtubules whilst the coenocytic plasmodium does 
      not possess any cytoplasmic microtubules--at either interphase or mitosis. In 
      plasmodia microtubules are, however, elaborated by an intranuclear microtubule 
      organizing centre (MTOC) during prophase of mitosis and these microtubules proceed 
      to form part of the mitotic spindle. There is little difference in the overall 
      distribution and arrangement of microtubules during division of either the 
      myxamoebal or plasmodial nuclei. These findings are discussed in relation to the 
      synthesis of tubulin during the plasmodial cell cycle and the rearrangements of the 
      nuclear envelope during mitosis.

TI  - Methylation of nuclear DNA in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 859-62
AB  - The restriction endonucleases HpaII and HhaI, whose action is inhibited by the 
      presence of methylated base analogues at the recognition sequences in the DNA 
      substrate, were used to investigate the distribution of 5-methylcytosine in nuclear 
      DNA from Physarum polycephalum. Physarum DNA is digested into two fractions by these 
      enzymes: a low-molecular-weight (M--) compartment comprising 80% of the DNA, and a 
      high-molecular-weight (M+) compartment containing 20% of the DNA. The DNA fraction 
      showing resistance to digestion by restriction endonuclease HpaII is cleaved by its 
      isoschizomer MspI, indicating that methylated endonuclease-HpaII-specific sites are 
      present in M + DNA. Additional properties of sequences in the M+ compartment were 
      investigated.

AB  - Some kinetic characteristics of soluble and particulate cyclic 3',5'-AMP 
      phosphodiesterases from Physarum polycephalum are presented. The nature of enzyme 
      inhibition by various agents is reported. The relationship between various enzyme 
      inhibitors and their reported chemotactic properties in Physarum is examined. The 
      results suggest that the chemoattractant effect of several inhibitors may be related 
      to their ability to inhibit the particulate and extracellular phosphodiesterases, 
      but is unrelated to inhibition of the intracellular enzyme.

      rate of movement and shortened the length of the cycles of shuttle streaming, but 
      did not affect the chemotactic response. The drugs DL-amphetamine, cannabinol and 
      heroin diminished the rate of movement, whereas Na-barbitol misled the chemotactic 
      response.

AB  - Incorporation of [3H]uridine into polyribosomes and polyribosomal RNA at different 
      stages of the cell cycle of myxomycete Physarum polycephalum was investigated. It 
      has been shown that at the early S-stage (during the first hour after mitosis) there 
      is no rRNA synthesis. About 10--12% of polyribosomal RNA, synthesized during this 
      period is poly(A)+RNA. Approximately 50% of poly(A)-RNA sediments as 4--6S and 
      20--25% as 7--14S in sucrose density gradient. It has been found that labeled RNA is 
      associated with the light polyribosome fractions. The bulk of RNA synthesized during 
      other periods of the cell cycle consists of rRNA, which is evenly distributed 
      between different polysome fractions. We suppose that light polyribosomes are 
      involved in the protein synthesis at the early S-stage of the cell cycle. 4--6S and 
      7--14S polyribosomal poly(A)-RNA was investigated by electrophoresis in denaturing 
      conditions. By comparing with other organisms we may suppose that the 7--14S 
      poly(A)-RNA, synthesized during the beginning of the S-stage is histone messenger 
      RNA.

AB  - The RNA synthesis detected by incorporation of [H3]uridine chase label proceeds in 
      macroplasmodium and in isolated nuclei throughout the cell cycle of a synchronous 
      myxomycetes culture of Physarum polycephalum, producing two well-shaped peaks at the 
      postmitotic and premitotic steps. Such RNA synthesis is due to the activity of 
      alpha-amanitin-sensitive RNA-polymerase II. Concentrations of RNA-polymerase II at 
      various steps of the cell cycle were determined by alpha-amanitin titration; the 
      specific activity of the enzyme was assayed. The increase in the rate of mRNA 
      synthesis was accompanied by a rise in the concentration and specific activity of 
      the enzyme: for the postmitotic peak, for instance, the corresponding values were 
      about 2-2.5 and 2-4 times as high as minimum values revealed during the cycle. The 
      results obtained are discussed in terms of transcription control in eukaryotic 
      systems.

PG  - 1076-82
AB  - Possible involvement of extracellular cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase in the control 
      of cell motile behavior has been investigated in Physarum polycephalum plasmodium, a 
      multinuclear amoeboid cell with the autooscillatory mode of motility. It was found 
      that the rate of the hydrolysis of 10 mM cAMP by a partially purified preparation of 
      cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase secreted by the plasmodium in the course of 
      migration decreases 20-30 times under the action of 1 mM dithiothreitol. In the 
      presence of 1-5 mM of this strong reducing agent, the onset of the plasmodium 
      spreading and the transition to the stage of migration were delayed in a 
      concentration-dependent manner. In accordance with the morphological pattern of 
      motile behavior, the duration of the maintenance of high frequency autooscillations, 
      which normally precede the increase in the rate of the spreading and appear also in 
      response to the application of attractants at spatially uniform concentrations, 
      strongly increased by the action of dithiothreitol. The results obtained suggest 
      that the autocrine production of cAMP and extracellular cAMP-specific 
      phosphodiesterase is an important constituent of the mechanism controlling the 
      motile behavior of the Physarum polycephalum plasmodium.

TI  - Toxicity of heavy metals and insecticides on slime mold Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 293-303
AB  - Toxicity of heavy metals and insecticides on the slime mold Physarum polycephalum 
      was investigated in order to examine and estimate with ease the toxicity of 
      environmental and occupational contaminants and also to study the effects of various 
      agents on the cell membrane. Changes in survival time and in membrane potential of 
      the slime mold were measured using a double chamber method. The results obtained 
      suggest that their toxicity for the slime mold is accompanied by some change in the 
      cell membrane, and that studies on toxicity for various chemical substances in the 
      slime mold can be used as a screening method.

AB  - A glycolipid which was expressed during a differentiation from haploid myxoamoebae 
      to diploid plasmodia of a true slime mold, Physarum polycephalum, has been examined. 
      In the amoeboid stage, cells did not contain this glycolipid, but after conjugation 
      of the haploid cells, this substance appeared and increased in its amount. From 
      structural studies of the purified glycolipid, it has been identified as 
      poriferasterol monoglucoside.

      approximately six months.

TI  - A morphogen for the sporulation of Physarum polycephalum detected by cell fusion 
      experiments.
PG  - 453-7
AB  - The light stimulus, which under conditions of starvation induces the development of 
      sporangia in the slime mold Physarum polycephalum, can be transferred from the 
      light-exposed part to the unexposed part of a plasmodium by means of plasma 
      circulation. A small quantity of protoplasm from a sporulating donor plasmodium, 
      which had passed through the premorphogenetic phase, was transferred by a short 
      period fusion with a briefly starved, light-induction-incompetent acceptor 
      plasmodium. This led to sporulation and even to a reduction of the premorphogenetic 
      phase from 9 down to 3 h in the acceptor plasmodium. After fusion with a sporulating 
      plasmodium, a highly starved plasmodium from a non-sporogenic culture line or a 
      growing plasmodium from a normal line prevents further morphogenesis of sporangia in 
      the sporulating partner.

TI  - The structure of chromatin synthesized in the presence of cycloheximide in Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 221-31
AB  - The effect of cycloheximide on protein and DNA synthesis and on the structure of 
      chromatin was studied. Changes in the rate and extent of DNA synthesis in response 
      to cycloheximide were highly variable in contrast to the extremely rapid and 
      reproducible inhibition of protein synthesis. No differences in the rate of the 
      release of acid-soluble products by nucleases and in the nature of the nucleoprotein 
      particles were found in chromatin from plasmodia treated and non-treated with 
      cycloheximide. It is concluded that, in Physarum polycephalum, unlike in higher 
      animals, chromatin from the antibiotic-treated plasmodia is structurally 
      indiscernible by the methods applied from normal chromatin.

AB  - Microtubule-interacting proteins have been studied in the lower eukaryote Physarum

      extracts of at least six polypeptides that bind specifically to amoebal 
      microtubules, 2) the binding between these proteins and mammalian microtubules, 3) 
      the heat stability of two of these polypeptides (125 and 235 kDa), 4) the functional 
      properties of a fraction containing a heat-soluble 125 kDa polypeptide, and 5) the 
      phosphorylation of the 125 kDa polypeptide during two distinct periods of the cell 
      cycle in Physarum synchronous plasmodia, first at late S/early G2 phase and second 
      at late G2/prophase.

TI  - Plasmodium formation in Physarum polycephalum: cytological events and their timing 
      relative to commitment.
PG  - 819-25
AB  - Amoebae of "selfing" strains of Physarum polycephalum transform into multinucleate 
      plasmodia without change in ploidy. The transformation occurs when cultures of 
      amoebae reach sufficiently high cell densities or when cultures of low densities are 
      exposed through filters to dense "inducing" cultures of amoebae. We have induced 
      selfing amoebae to transform individually and in populations in order to study 
      cytological changes and their timing relative to the irreversible commitment of 
      cells to plasmodium formation. An increase in cell size was observed to precede 
      commitment, and the first nuclear mitosis, which gives rise to a binucleate cell, 
      was found to follow commitment.

TI  - The characterisation of a 5-S 'monosome' fraction from chromatin of Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 831-9
AB  - A so-called '5-S mononucleosome' fraction was isolated from nuclei of Physarum 
      polycephalum by digestion with micrococcal nuclease and subsequent fractionation by 
      gel filtration. This fraction had electrophoretic and sedimentation properties which 
      were similar to DNA of approximately 140 base pairs in length. It is shown that 
      lysis of the nuclei activates a protease which is resistant to phenyl-methyl 
      sulphonyl fluoride, o-phenanthroline and parachloromercuri benzene sulphonate and 
      which subsequently degrades the nucleosomes.

PG  - 129-33
AB  - 1. During synchronous growth of the acellular slime mould Physarum polycephalum the 
      free amino pool had two maxima, one of 650 units [nmol/plasmodium dry weight (mg)] 
      at metaphase and the other of 780 units in mid G2 with minima of 550 units before 
      and after mitosis. 2. Proline formed 20--25% of the total pool with aspartic acid, 
      glutamic acid, threonine, valine, leucine, lysine and arginine making up 55% of the 
      pool. 3. The fluctuation of proline during the mitotic cycle was quite different 
      from that of the other amino acids and was transiently very low during telophase.

PG  - 139-50
AB  - Synchronous cultures of Physarum polycephalum were pulsed with [3H]lysine 
      hydrochloride in S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. Plasmodial extracts were 
      separated into nuclear, ribosomal and acid-soluble post-ribosomal cytoplasmic 
      fractions. Core histones could be detected by staining in the nuclear fractions of 
      both S and G2 phases, but were not detected by staining in the cytoplasmic 
      fractions. Newly synthesized histone was present in S-phase nuclei but not in 
      S-phase cytoplasm. The specific activity of newly synthesized histone in G2-phase 
      nuclei decreased by at least 95% compared to S phase and no newly synthesized 
      histone was observed in G2-phase cytoplasmic fractions. Thus histone synthesis is 
      restricted to S phase. There are no free pools of histone in the cytoplasm of 
      Physarum in either S or G2 phases of the cell cycle.

TI  - Thymidylate synthetase during synchronous nuclear division cycle and differentiation 
      of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 83-8
AB  - Thymidylate synthetase and thymidine kinase activities in wild type strain M3b and 
      in thymidine kinase-deficient mutant TU63 of Physarum polycephalum are studied. 
      Whenever nuclear division occurs in macroplasmodia of wild type, thymidine kinase 
      and thymidylate synthetase activities sharply increase, although the increase of 
      thymidylate synthetase activity is less pronounced than thymidine kinase activity. 
      This is also true for other investigated nuclear divisions during the life cycle of 
      P. polycephalum. It is shown for the first time that thymidylate synthetase is a 
      periodically fluctuating enzyme during the naturally synchronous nuclear division 
      cycle of P. polycephalum with a peak of specific activity in the S phase. In 
      macroplasmodia, as well as after germination of microsclerotia of M3b, thymidine 
      kinase is the dominant enzyme, whereas at the time of the precleavage mitosis in 
      sporulating macroplasmodia thymidylate synthetase is the predominant enzyme. This 
      study describes and compares both dTMP-synthesizing enzymes during proliferation and 
      differentiation of the same organism.

AB  - Lamin-like proteins have been identified as components of the nuclear matrix of the 
      myxomycete Physarum polycephalum. A 67 kDa homologue was detected by immunoblotting 
      of nuclear matrix proteins with affinity-purified anti-lamin antibodies of human 
      autoimmune sera. A 65 kDa lamin B homologue was identified with polyclonal 
      antibodies against turkey erythrocyte lamin B in nuclei and nuclear matrix of 
      Physarum amoebae and plasmodia. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that 
      the 65 and 67 kDa proteins are localized in the nuclear lamina of plasmodial nuclei.

AB  - The expression of an alpha-tubulin gene (altB1 (N alpha Tu) [(1987) J. Mol. Biol. 
      193, 427-438]) of Physarum polycephalum (strain CLdAXE) was found to be governed by 
      a developmental switch since mRNA transcripts were detected, by S1 nuclease 
      analysis, in the plasmodial but not the amoebal phase of the life-cycle. The 
      conclusion that the altB1 (N alpha Tu) allele codes for a plasmodial specific 
      alpha-tubulin isotype is supported by recent amino acid sequence data.

TI  - DNA replication in Physarum polycephalum. Analysis of replicating nuclear DNA using 
      the electron microscope.
PG  - 161-7
AB  - DNA has been isolated from Physarum polycephalum nuclei obtained from macroplasmodia 
      at different stages in the mitotic cycle, and examined using the electron 
      microscope. Putative replicating structures were identified, the majority of which 
      contained clusters of 2--37 'microbubbles', each microbubble corresponding to a 
      segment of DNA 100--5000 nucleotides long. The microbubble-containing structures are 
      unstable in the formamide hyperphase used to prepare specimens for electron 
      microscopy, possibly due to dissociation of newly replicated nascent DNA fragments 
      from the parental DNA template during manipulation. The microbubble clusters present 
      in early S-phase DNA extent over segments averaging 16400 nucleotide residues, and 
      are separated by non-replicated regions of DNA varying in length from 10000 to 50000 
      nucleotides. It is suggested that each microbubble cluster may represent a 
      'replicon', and that many 'replicons' in Physarum DNA may contain several sites for 
      the initiation of DNA synthesis that are active during S-phase.

AB  - Transcriptionally active and inactive chromatin fractions were isolated from 
      Physarum polycephalum after depolymerization of chromatin with DNAase II or 
      micrococcal nuclease, followed by fractionation in 5 mM-MgCl2. The active fraction 
      of chromatin comprised up to 21% of nuclear DNA and was enriched 22-fold in the 
      labelled nascent RNA. Both chromatin fractions were shown to have the nucleosomal 
      structure. DNA of the active fraction of chromatin was degraded much faster with 
      DNAase I and micrococcal nuclease than the DNA of the inactive fraction.

AB  - A method is described for the isolation of pulse-labelled RNA from nuclei and 
      subnuclear fractions of Physarum polycephalum. At all times during interphase the 
      nucleolar RNA consisted mainly of a 34-S rRNA precursor with only small amounts of 
      26-S and 19-S rRNAs. The nucleoplasmic RNA consisted of predominantly mature 26-S 
      rRNA with small amounts of 19-S rRNA and a 30-S RNA species. The 30-S RNA component 
      displayed different labelling kinetics from the rRNA precursors. A low molecular 
      weight RNA fraction (4-8 S) appeared to accumulate in the nucleus as interphase 
      progressed.

TI  - The relation of cycling of intracellular pH to mitosis in the acellular slime mould 
      Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 297-303
AB  - The relation between intracellular pH and the mitotic cycle of Physarum polycephalum 
      was studied by two-independent techniques. Both techniques revealed a long term 
      cycling of intracellular pH which has the same period as the mitotic cycle, 
      Qualitative detection of the changes in intracellular pH was made by measuring the 
      changes in fluorescence of 4-methylesculetin which had been absorbed by the 
      plasmodium. Quantitative measurements of intracellular pH were made throughout the 
      mitotic cycle with antimony micro pH electrodes. The cycle of intracellular pH is 
      sinusoidal in appearance. The maximum intracellular pH (pH 6.6) occurred at, or very 
      near to, mitosis, and was approximately 0.6 pH units higher than the minimum pH, 
      which occurred near the middle of the mitotic cycle.

TI  - Flow cytometry of the differentiation of Physarum polycephalum myxamoebae to cysts.
PG  - 173-81
AB  - Myxamoebae of Physarum polycephalum, strain Cld, were grown on agar lawns on live 
      bacteria. Myxamoebae were harvested, fixed and stained with propidium iodide. Flow 
      cytometry showed that, as in the case of Physarum plasmodia, there is no G1 phase 
      during rapid exponential growth. However, an apparent G1 phase was observed at the 
      end of exponential growth when the culture arrested with the G1 DNA content for 
      about a day between growth and differentiation. Most myxamoebae differentiated into 
      cysts, but some formed microplasmodia and others appeared to lose DNA. The cysts 
      possessed the G2 phase DNA content and there was an S phase connecting the 
      G1-arrested state with the encysted state. Encystment was blocked by hydroxyurea 
      (HU) suggesting that DNA synthesis is essential for encystment. The natural 
      temporary synchronization in G1 phase may provide the basis of a method for 
      selecting mutants with a conditional block in G2 or M phases.

PG  - 219-23
AB  - The proteins of nuclear matrix preparations from Physarum polycephalum were compared 
      with analogous mammalian fractions by gel electrophoresis, DNA-binding studies and 
      immunological tests. Polypeptides of 28 and 36 K dalton, which dominate in Physarum 
      preparations, differed from calf thymus matrix proteins in that they were basic and 
      showed low affinity to DNA. These polypeptides were present at about 1.2 mg per mg 
      of nuclear DNA. Polypeptides of higher molecular weight occurred in the preparation 
      at about 0.5 mg per mg of nuclear DNA. At least some of the latter proteins showed 
      high affinity to DNA and cross-reacted with the antiserum against calf thymus matrix 
      proteins.

      microscopy.
PG  - 21-32
AB  - 1. The composition of purified wall fragments from the spherule wall of Physarum 
      polycephalum has been studied. 2. Spherule wall fragments consist of two major 
      components. More than one-half of the wall material is glycoproteins. The remaining 
      wall material after fractionation has a high carbohydrate to protein ratio and is 
      suggested to be composed of proteoglycan(s). 3. The predominant monosaccharide 
      constituent of the proteoglycan is galactosamine. The protein component is unique. 
      It is composed almost entirely of phenylalanine (87--92 mol%). 4. Approx. 50% of 
      these proteoglycans are resistant to alkali extraction and in negative stained 
      preparation for the electron microscope consist of short spindle-shaped fibrils 
      which measure 100 nm in length and 8 nm in diameter. These fibrils show a weak but 
      distinct X-ray diffraction pattern.

TI  - Spatio-temporal relationships between protoplasmic streaming and contraction 
      activities in plasmodial veins of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 317-34
AB  - Plasmodial veins of Physarum polycephalum were investigated by combining 
      cinematographical, morphological, and tensiometrical techniques. Translucent and 
      nontranslucent (thicker) strands remaining in their original position on filter 
      paper were analyzed in respect to their radial contraction cycles and the resulting 
      streaming activity of the endoplasm. A new technique for measuring the flow 
      intensity by a microbalance method allowed testing of the influence of radial 
      contraction on actual streaming processes within a strand. Stationary ectoplasm and 
      flowing endoplasm are involved in a mutual transformation process: thereia an 
      exchange of ectoplasm and endoplasm in the form of protoplasmic streamlets crossing 
      the borderline between the endoplasmic stream and the ectoplasmic tube. Radial 
      contraction cycles show the same time periodicity as the endoplasmic shuttle 
      streaming. Relationships between radial contractions, streaming rates of endoplasm 
      and streamlets between ectoplasm and endoplasm were analyzed. The participation of 
      the ectoplasmic walls in motive force generation and their function in control of 
      streaming throughput is discussed.

PG  - 538644
LID - 10.3389/fpsyg.2020.538644 [doi]
LID - 538644
AB  - A widely cited roadblock to bridging ecological psychology and enactivism is that 
      the former identifies with realism and the latter identifies with constructivism, 
      which critics charge is subjectivist. A pragmatic reading, however, suggests 
      non-mental forms of constructivism that simultaneously fit core tenets of enactivism 
      and ecological realism. After advancing a pragmatic version of enactive 
      constructivism that does not obviate realism, I reinforce the position with an 
      empirical illustration: Physarum polycephalum, a communal unicellular organism that 
      leaves slime trails that form chemical barriers that it avoids in foraging 
      explorations. Here, environmental building and sensorimotor engagement are part of 
      the same process with P. polycephalum coordinating around self-created, 
      affordance-bearing geographies, which nonetheless exist independently in ways 
      described by ecological realists. For ecological psychologists, affordances are 
      values, meaning values are external to the perceiver. I argue that agent-enacted 
      values have the same status and thus do not obviate ecological realism or generate 
      subjectivism. The constructivist-realist debate organizes around the emphasis that 
      enactivists and ecological theorists respectively place on the inner constitution of 
      organisms vs. the structure of environments. Building on alimentary themes 
      introduced in the P. polycephalum example and also in Gibson's work, I go on to 
      consider how environment, brain, visceral systems, and even bacteria within them 
      enter perceptual loops. This highlights almost unfathomable degrees of mutually 
      modulating internal and external synchronization. It also shows instances in which 
      internal conditions alter worldly configurations and invert values, in Gibson's 
      sense of the term, albeit without implying subjectivism. My aim is to cut across the 
      somatic focus of enactive constructivism and the external environment-oriented 
      emphasis of ecological realism and show that enactivism can enrich ecological 
      accounts of value.

TI  - Histone phosphorylation during repression of proliferation in a lower eucaryote 
      Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 518-24
AB  - Nutrient depletion causes a rapid drop in transcription and completely inhibits DNA 
      replication in plasmodia of a slime mold Physarum polycephalum. These events are 
      accompanied by progressive dephosphorylation of histone H3 and no change in the 
      state of phosphorylation of the bulk of histone H1. This shows that the compaction 
      of chromatin associated with transcriptional inactivation does not require 
      phosphorylation of H3 and suggests that the level of basal phosphorylation of H1 is 
      not correlated with the intensity of transcription or DNA replication. An increase 
      in the proportion of unmethylated versus methylated H1 is visible, suggesting a role 
      for this H1 modification in the regulation of chromatin functioning.

TI  - DNA synthesis in isolated nuclei from synchronized plasmodia of Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 243-50
AB  - Nuclei were isolated from synchronized plasmodia of a true slime mold, Physarum 
      polycephalum, in S-phase, and DNA synthesis in the nuclei was studied in vitro. The 
      nuclei catalyzed DNA synthesis at the rate of 0.7 ng DNA/1.0 X 10(6) nuclei/30 min 
      at 25 degrees C, which was 5 times higher than that catalyzed in G2-phase nuclei. 
      The DNA synthesis required Mg2+, four kinds of deoxyribonucleoside 5'-triphosphates 
      and ATP, suggesting that the mode of synthesis is a replicative-type, but not a 
      repair-one. Sedimentation analysis of the DNA products revealed that the nuclei 
      produced 2-4S DNA fragments mainly during a 30-sec pulse incubation, and 2-4S, 5-12S 
      and longer fragments during a 15-min incubation. The pulse- and chase-labeling 
      experiments showed that the 2-4S fragments shifted discontinuously to longer 
      fragments. These results indicate that the nuclei catalyze the formation of 2-4S 
      Okazaki fragments first and then their subsequent ligation. Eighty % and 96% of the 
      DNA synthesis was inhibited by 200 micrograms/ml aphidicolin and 40 mM 
      N-ethylmaleimide, respectively, but 80% of the activity was resistant to 100 microM 
      2',3'-dideoxythymidine 5'-triphosphate. These results suggest that the DNA synthesis 
      is catalyzed by the alpha-type DNA polymerase of Physarum polycephalum.

TI  - Response of Aspergillus nidulans and Physarum polycephalum to microwave irradiation.
PG  - 75-80
AB  - The influence of microwaves on genetic processes in Aspergillus nidulans and 
      Physarum polycephalum was investigated. Suspensions of organisms were exposed in the 
      far zone to 2450-MHz waves at 10 mW/cm2 for one hour in both CW and pulsed (1 
      microsecond, 600 pps) fields. Spores of A. nidulans were irradiated before and 
      during germination. No changes in survival rate or in frequency of morphological 
      mutation were found. Polycephalum under the influence of CW microwaves incorporated 
      3H-Thymine into DNA at a rate five times that of controls and twice that of thermal 
      controls. The accelerated synthesis may reflect more efficient volume heating by 
      microwaves, or in the presence of microthermal gradients in suspensions, or 
      field-specific influences in concern with focal or volume heating.

      proliferation (microplasmodia, macroplasmodia, germinating microsclerotia and 
      germinating spores) tk is the dominant enzyme in terms of activity, whereas ts is 
      the predominant enzyme in quiescent stages (microsclerotia, sporangia, respectively 
      spores); this is expressed by calculating the tk/ts ratio. This ratio is greater 
      than 1 during proliferation and much less than 1 during quiescence. Our results 
      clearly show that ts is the basic enzyme for dTMP production during all 
      differentiation stages, whereas tk, if required, is shut on and represents an 
      additional potential for dTMP synthesis during rapid proliferation.

      products made in vivo in the presence of cycloheximide in strains sensitive and 
      resistant to cycloheximide.
PG  - 405-13
AB  - Synchronous plasmodia of cycloheximide-sensitive and cycloheximide-resistant strains 
      of Physarum polycephalum were labelled with 3[H]-deoxyadenosine in pulse and 
      pulse-chase experiments in presence and absence of cycloheximide. The replication 
      products were studied with alkaline sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis. We show 
      that the action of cycloheximide on DNA replication in Physarum is mediated through 
      the ribosome, since the ribosomally located resistance also makes the plasmodial DNA 
      replication refractile to the action of cycloheximide. Cycloheximide caused 
      inhibition of three stages in DNA replication in the wild type: first, the formation 
      of primary replication units ("Okazaki" size fragments), secondly, the ligation of 
      primary units into secondary ("Replicon" size) units and thirdly, the ligation of 
      secondary units into mature DNA.

      discussed.

      polycephalum, the cloning of the gene in Escherichia coli with plasmid vector DNAs 
      was performed and 8 different kinds of clones containing 26S, 19S, and 5.85 rRNA 
      genes were obtained. Using these cloned fragments, the location of these rRNA genes 
      was determined by the Southern hybridization and S1 mapping method. Cloning of rDNA 
      fragments made it possible to analyze the fine structure of the rDNA.

      chromatin even under conditions when the nuclease cleaves preferentially the dAT 
      regions in DNA. 5-Bromodeoxyuridine label does not significantly affect the 
      DNA/protein ratio in chromatin; this is reflected by similar behaviour of normal and 
      substituted chromatin in metrizamide-density gradients.

TI  - The replication of ribosomal DNA in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 557-66
AB  - The DNA coding for ribosomal RNA in Physarum polycephalum exists as a collection of 
      extra-chromosomal molecules of molecular weight 37 X 10(6). We have investigated the 
      replication of rDNA, with the following results. (a) Replication of rDNA is 
      unscheduled. This means that molecules that are replicated at any particular time in 
      one mitotic cycle have an equal probability of replicating again in each time 
      interval in the subsequent cycle. Similarly, in a single cycle, some molecules 
      replicate more than once, and some not at all. (b) Replication forks appear to move 
      bidirectionally from points 45% or 33% from one end of the DNA. Replicating 
      molecules observed by electron microscopy are all linear.

      An isocratic high-pressure liquid-chromatography method.
PG  - 805-11
AB  - A5'pppp5'A has been proposed to serve as a molecular signal that triggers DNA 
      replication. When published methods proved to be inadequate for the assay of 
      A5'pppp5'A in Physarum polycephalum by h.p.l.c. (high-pressure liquid 
      chromatography), a set of purification procedures was developed that allowed assay 
      of as little as 2pmol of A5'pppp5'A. A5'pppp5'A was purified from cellular extract 
      by covalent boronate chromatography, treated with alkaline phosphatase to hydrolyse 
      residual mononucleotides and analysed by isocratic ion-exchange h.p.l.c. The 
      analysis was facilitated by a pre-column switching procedure that allowed 
      early-eluted species to be diverted from the analytical column. By using this 
      procedure A5'pppp5'A has been detected in Physarum polycephalum (1.4 pmol/mg of 
      protein), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (3.6 pmol/mg of protein) and rat liver (3.3 
      pmol/mg of protein). In each case a minor peak was also seen, which was identified 
      as A5'pppp5'G. The identity of both peaks was confirmed by co-elution with standards 
      on isocratic and gradient h.p.l.c. and treatment with enzymes, including a 
      dinucleoside polyphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase from Physarum polycephalum.

TI  - A comparison of the proteins of the amoebal and plasmodial phases of the slime 
      mould, Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 533-8
AB  - 1. The proteins of amoebae and plasmodia of strain CL of Physarum polycephalum have 
      been compared by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Both forms of the organism 
      were labelled by growth on formalin-killed bacteria labelled with [35S]sulphate, 
      [3H]lysine or [14C]lysine. Plasmodia were also labelled from radioactive lysine in 
      the medium. 2. Of 306 relatively abundant proteins examined, 26% were 
      phase-specific, that is they were found only in amoebae or in plasmodia. About a 
      quarter of these apparent differences in gene expression may be due to minor changes 
      in charge and/or size. 3. Amongst the 74% of the proteins present in both amoebae 
      and plasmodia, there are substantial differences in differential rates of synthesis 
      and these have been measured for a representative set of proteins by a double-label 
      procedure.

TI  - Nucleic acids and related enzymes. Secretion of four alkaline DNases by plasmodia of 
      Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 1715-21
AB  - In plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum, DNase activity with a preference for native 
      DNA was found in a pattern of three or four isoenzymes. During growth a constant 
      specific activity of approx. 0.3 unit of DNase activity per mg protein was found in 
      the plasmodia, with a broad maximum during the G2-phase in the naturally synchronous 
      flat cultures. Under conditions of starvation or sclerotization, DNase activity was 
      secreted by the plasmodia in amounts which were up to ten times higher than the 
      internal level of enzyme activity. Purification of the secreted DNase activity to 
      high purity by three simple chromatographic steps showed that four different DNase 
      isoenzymes existed which were identical with the intracellular ones. The relative 
      abundances of the various isoenzyme forms inside and outside the plasmodia seemed to 
      be slightly different. The possible functions of the DNase activities are discussed.

TI  - An extracellular inducer of asexual plasmodium formation in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 1120-4
AB  - Asexual conversion of amoebae to plasmodia was studied in the Colonia isolate of the 
      myxomycete, Physarum polycephalum. When a culture of Colonia amoebae is grown on a 
      bacterial lawn, a period of amoebic growth precedes the appearance of cells 
      committed to the plasmodial state. The onset of plasmodium production appears to be 
      related to amoebic nutrition since cultures supplied with fewer bacteria display 
      earlier differentiation. For a period of time after differentiation is initiated, 
      conversion of amoebae to plasmodia is rapid and proceeds as an exponential function 
      of time. A filter-transmissible substance, apparently released by differentiating 
      cells, is implicated in the control of this rapid conversion.

TI  - Magnetic nanoparticles-loaded Physarum polycephalum: Directed growth and particles 
      distribution.
AB  - Slime mold Physarum polycephalum is a single cell visible by an unaided eye. The 
      slime mold optimizes its network of protoplasmic tubes to minimize expose to 
      repellents and maximize expose to attractants and to make efficient transportation 
      of nutrients. These properties of P. polycephalum, together with simplicity of its 
      handling and culturing, make it a priceless substrate for designing novel sensing, 
      computing and actuating architectures in living amorphous biological substrate. We 
      demonstrate that, by loading Physarum with magnetic particles and positioning it in 
      a magnetic field, we can, in principle, impose analog control procedures to 
      precisely route active growing zones of slime mold and shape topology of its 
      protoplasmic networks.

PG  - 89-94
AB  - The level of constitutive heat shock protein 70 (HSC70) in Physarum polycephalum was 
      analyzed by means of Western blots during the synchronous cell cycle of 
      macroplasmodia. Total amounts as well as nuclear and cytoplasmic contents were 
      determined separately and evaluated densitometrically. A drastic increase of nuclear 
      HSC70 was observed 10-40 min after the initiation of S phase (600% of the M phase 
      value) and thereafter a slow decline toward the next M phase. Total HSC levels 
      showed a slight (30%) increase during S phase whereas cytoplasmic HSC70 was about 
      30% lower during S phase compared to mitosis.

AB  - Nuclease digestion studies of Physarum polycephalum nuclei (1-3) and nucleoli (4)

      re-investigated one such particle, peak A, using the techniques of differential 
      melting and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and show that this material is 
      unlikely to be a specific histone:DNA complex as suggested by earlier authors.

TI  - The linear extrachromosomal DNA of Physarum polycephalum replicates and is 
      maintained under non-selective conditions in two different lower eukaryotes.
PG  - 1855-69
AB  - The slime mould Physarum polycephalum contains 100 to 200 molecules of 
      extrachromosomal linear DNA (PeDNA). Two sets of the 19S and 26S ribosomal genes are 
      located on each molecule of PeDNA. In the nonmitotic phase of the cell cycle PeDNA 
      is localised in the nucleolus. The molecules are maintained throughout vegetative 
      growth. In order to study the signals responsible for its maintenance, PeDNA was 
      purified and introduced into the two distantly related yeasts Saccharomyces 
      cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Surprisingly, intact PeDNA transforms both 
      yeasts with high frequency and PeDNA sequences are maintained in the absence of 
      selective pressure.

TI  - Differentiation response of Physarum polycephalum to macrocysts at various times in 
      nuclear cycle.
PG  - 436-42
AB  - Macrocyst (spherule) formation was induced in synchronized suspension cultures of 
      microplasmodia of Physarum polycephalum under conditions where DNA synthesis was 
      inhibited. Plasmodia in early G2 phase of nuclear cycle were able to differentiate 
      to spherules in the presence of an inhibitor of DNA synthesis, whereas those in late 
      G2 phase required another round of DNA replication before they could enter into the 
      spherulation process. These facts suggest that commitment to DNA synthesis occurred 
      about halfway through G2 phase. The idea was also supported by the results of 
      autoradiographic study in which spherulating plasmodia were fed with radioactive 
      thymidine and labelled plasmodia were scored at the terminal differentiation stage.

TI  - Metabolic stability of the extrachromosomal ribosomal RNA genes in the slime mould 
      Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 45-50
AB  - The rRNA genes of the slime mould Physarum polycephalum are located on free, linear 
      DNA molecules of a discrete size, Mr=38X10(6). Using an isotope dilution technique 
      we have examined the metabolic stability of these extrachromosomal genes during 
      active, balanced growth. Microplasmodia, prelabelled with [3H]thymidine, were used 
      to prepare synchronous surface plasmodial cultures which were subsequently grown on 
      unlabelled medium. The gross synthesis of ribosomal DNA was then determined over 
      three consecutive mitotic divisions from the ratio of 3H to 14C in a hybrid formed 
      between the extracted ribosomal [3H]DNA and a [14C]rRNA probe. It was found that 
      ribosomal DNA, like chromosomal DNA, is completely stable during active growth.

TI  - ATP- and calcium-controlled contraction in a saponin model of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 135-41
AB  - Saponin models of the plasmodial strand of Physarum polycephalum were constructed to 
      study how Ca2+ and ATP regulate the generation of tension. ATP-induced isometric 
      tension in a saponin model increased with an increase in ATP concentration until 
      maximum tension (0.3-1.7 mg) was reached at about 1 mM. The sensitivity of the model 
      to ATP was heightened three to five times in a basic solution containing an 
      ATP-regenerating system, the maximum tension (0.3-0.6 mg) being reached at 0.2 to 
      0.3 mM ATP. Contraction of the model also depended on the Ca2+ concentration 
      irrespective of the presence or absence of the ATP-regenerating system. The optimal 
      pCa was 7.0, and tension decreased with a Ca2+ concentration above or below this 
      value. These results indicate that the tension generated in the plasmodial strand of 
      Physarum in vivo may be regulated by ATP and/or Ca2+.

TI  - Periodic organisation of foldback sequences in Physarum polycephalum nuclear DNA.
PG  - 2405-23
AB  - Nuclear DNA from the slime mould Physarum polycephalum is shown to contain 
      interspersed inverted repeat sequences, such that denatured fragments of DNA 
      containing pairs of these sequences form intra-chain duplexes under appropriate 
      conditions. The organisation and distribution of the nucleotide sequences 
      responsible for the formation of foldback structures in Physarum DNA have been 
      investigated using the electron microscope. The majority of foldback duplexes have 
      sizes ranging up to 800 base pairs, and about 60-80% of DNA molecules 2.2 X 10(4) 
      bases in length contain interspersed foldback elements. The size of individual 
      foldback duplexes, and also the length of the intervening sequences which separate 
      them, are non-random. The results can best be explained by a model in which separate 
      foldback foci in Physarum DNA are spaced periodically at regular intervals. The 
      regions containing foldback foci are thought to contain smaller, tandemly-arranged 
      sequences of discrete sizes, in some cases related to other nucleotide sequences of 
      a similar nature in the same locality in Physarum DNA.

TI  - Adenosine triphosphate and synchronous mitosis in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 330-7
AB  - Synchronous mitoses occur in Physarum polycephalum in the absence of cell division. 
      Nucleoside and nucleotide profiles were prepared from synchronously growing P. 
      polycephalum at intervals throughout the growth cycle. Comparison of these profiles 
      demonstrates that the pool of adenosine triphosphate decreases from a high level at 
      prophase to a minimum through mitosis and increases again in the postmitotic period. 
      These events appear to coincide with changes in the pools of adenosine diphosphate 
      and adenosine but not with that of adenosine monophosphate. This observed decrease 
      in the pool of adenosine triphosphate during mitosis was confirmed by direct 
      enzymatic assay. These results presumably reflect the energy demands of the cell 
      during mitosis.

      activity was expressed and increased definitely. In the plasmodial stage, high 
      enzyme activity was maintained constantly. The enzyme was partially purified 
      (35-fold purification, and 28% yield), and molecular weight of 72,000, pH optimum of 
      7.0, and some characteristics were demonstrated.

TI  - Induction of polyploid nuclei in the plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum by platinum 
      antitumor compounds.
PG  - 777-83
AB  - The intranuclear mitosis of the plasmodial nuclei of myxomycetes permits the 
      observation of defects in chromosomal repartition which would probably be lethal in 
      other eukaryotic cells with open mitosis. We found that antitumoral platinum-amine 
      compounds perturbed late mitotic events and induced the formation of giant nuclei 
      which were polyploid in plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum. Using 26 platinum-amine 
      complexes, we have shown that all antitumoral compounds induced the formation of 
      polyploid nuclei for drug concentrations at least three times lower than the amount 
      necessary to block the overall plasmodial growth, whereas platinum compounds without 
      antitumor activity did not behave this way. DNA replication appeared to be 
      quantitatively normal during formation of giant nuclei by antitumoral compounds. 
      These observations suggest that platinum-amine compounds exert their antitumor 
      activity by interfering with mitosis rather than by a gross inhibition of DNA 
      synthesis.

TI  - Hexosamine metabolism during spherule formation in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 243-52
AB  - Hexosamine metabolism in relation to the spherule-wall synthesis in Physarum 
      polycephalum was studied by the incorporation of labeled sugar into the wall and 
      intermediary compounds in the biosynthesis of wall polysaccharide. The incorporation 
      of [14C]galactosamine into the wall material occurred after a lag period of about 10 
      h in an induction medium. Nucleotides and sugar phosphates in the acid-soluble 
      fraction of spherulating plasmodia were analyzed by column chromatography on Dowex 
      1-X8 (formate). The primary labeled products formed in the spherulating plasmodia 
      after incubation with [14C]galactosamine were galactosamine 1-phosphate, 
      UDP-galactosamine, N-acetylhexosamine 6-phosphate and UDP-N-acetylhexosamine. 
      Spherulation was insensitive to polyoxin D, while it was completely blocked by 
      cycloheximide. The activity of galactokinase and galactose-1-phosphate 
      uridyltransferase increased 4--5-fold during the spherulation.

TI  - Post-fusion somatic incompatibility in plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 339-54
AB  - High-resolution autoradiography has been used to establish that during the 
      incompatibility reaction that follows fusion between plasmodia of a 'killer' and a 
      'sensitive' strain of the myxomycete Physarum polycephalum, the nuclei of the 
      sensitive strain are selectively damaged, enclosed in vacuoles and eliminated from 
      the cytoplasm. This damage is visible as increased chromatin condensation and 
      nucleolar segregation. Nuclear envelopes of both strains show blebbing, and there is 
      an increase in the size and frequency of cytoplasmic vesicles of endoplasmic 
      reticulum. Multiple nuclear fusions are seen between all combinations of genetically 
      like and unlike types of nuclei throughout the course of the incompatibility 
      reaction. After the reaction, mean nuclear diameters increase over 2-3 days to give 
      nuclei an order of magnitude greater in volume than the controls; the population 
      size range returns to normal in 4-5 days. Fusions between incompatible plasmodia 
      carried out when the killer strain is at or very near to mitosis do not produce an 
      immediate incompatibility reaction, but give plasmodia that are neutral and act as 
      neither killers nor sensitives; these heterokaryons convert to killer phenotypes 
      after a few days.

AB  - Methods for isolating nuclei, nucleoli and chromatin from Physarum polycephalum 
      which retain high levels of endogenous RNA polymerase activity are described. Under 
      carefully controlled conditions with respect to mono- and divalent cation 
      concentrations RNA synthesis in nuclei displayed linear kinetics for at least 30 min 
      and the RNA products had a similar size distribution to nuclear RNA synthesis 
      observed in vivo. Chromatin showed 60% of the nuclear transcriptional activity but 
      no conditions were found where faithful transcription of the template occurred. 
      Isolated nucleoli were 5-fold more active than nuclei and the endogenous RNA 
      polymerase activity was insensitive to alpha-amanitin. Under carefully controlled 
      conditions, the nucleoli appeared to support the accurate transcription, 
      re-initiation and processing of rRNA chains in vitro.

TI  - Viability of Physarum polycephalum spores and ploidy of plasmodial nuclei.
PG  - 473-6
AB  - Amoebae of Physarum polycephalum carrying the mth mating-type allele may 
      differentiate into plasmodia in the absence of mating. Such plasmodia are haploid 
      and, upon sporulation, produce mainly inviable spores. We have asked whether the 
      viable spores arise from meiotic or mitotic divisions. Using a microfluorometric 
      measurement of the deoxyribonucleic acid content of individual nuclei, we found the 
      fraction of viable spores to be correlated with the proportion of rare, diploid 
      nuclei containing in the generally haploid plasmodium. When homozygous diploid 
      plasmodia were created by heat shocking, spore viability increased dramatically. We 
      suggest that viable spores are produced via meiosis in mth plasmodia, that the mth 
      allele has no effect on sporulation per se, and that the normal source of viable 
      haploid spores is a small fraction of diploid nuclei ubiquitous in haploid 
      plasmodia.

TI  - Replication of nucleolus-associated DNA during "G2 phase" in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 229-36
AB  - In the myxomycete, Physarum polycephalum, the bulk of nuclear DNA replication occurs 
      during a period of a few hours immediately following upon mitosis. During the 
      remainder of the intermitotic period, incorporation of thymidine-(3)H continues at a 
      low rate in the region of the nucleolus (radioautographs). A few nuclei incorporated 
      thymidine-(3)H into the extranucleolar chromatin at a high rate at all times of the 
      intermitotic period. These nuclei were exceptionally large and they frequently 
      contained several small nucleoli of different sizes rather than the one, central 
      nucleolus which is characteristic of a normal interphase nucleus.

LID - 10.1007/BF00395403 [doi]
AB  - The influence of inhibitors of energy metabolism (2-deoxy-D-glucose, 
      monoiodoacetate, KCN) as well as various substrates for respiration (sodium acetate, 
      glycine, glutamine, α-ketoglutarate, pyruvate) were investigated with respect to the 
      effect of blue light (450 nm) on contractile behaviour of plasmodial strands of 
      Physarum polycephalum. When the energy metabolism is not experimentally modified, 
      blue light induces a prolongation of the period of the contraction-relaxation cycle. 
      This effect appears within 2-3 min and seems to represent the primary reaction of 
      this organism to blue light. Inhibition of respiration by KCN completely abolished 
      this response to blue-light irradiation. In contrast, an impediment of glycolysis 
      enhanced the effect. This indicates that the reaction to blue light is related to 
      respiration, i.e., to the function of mitochondria. Among different substrates for 
      respiration only α-ketoglutarate combined with pyruvate and applied in the presence 
      of inhibitors of glycolysis showed an enhancement of the photoresponse, i.e., a 
      prolongation of the period and an increase of the amplitude of the force 
      oscillations. This indicates that the pyruvate and α-ketoglutarate-dehydrogenase 
      complexes functioning in mitochondrial respiration are involved in the primary 
      blue-light reaction of plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum.

PG  - 3175-82
AB  - Restriction endonuclease analysis was done on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from 19 
      plasmodial strains of Physarum polycephalum. The extent of mtDNA variation among 
      these strains was high in comparison with other organisms, and provides a useful 
      source of cytoplasmic genetic markers. The strains were classified into seven groups 
      according to their mtDNA types. Although plasmodia of P. polycephalum are diploid, 
      formed by fusion of amoebal isogametes, each of the 19 plasmodia possessed mtDNA of 
      only a single type. The transmission pattern of mtDNA during plasmodium formation 
      was studied by mating pairs of amoebal strains that contained mtDNA of different 
      types. Transmission was uniparental; the plasmodia that were formed carried mtDNA 
      with the restriction pattern of only one of the two parental types. Since diploid 
      zygotes develop into plasmodia by repeated mitotic cycles in the absence of cell 
      division, it is clear that this uniparental transmission of mtDNA does not depend 
      upon random partitioning either of mitochondria or of mtDNA molecules during cell 
      division.

      in specimens with tight contact to a substratum. The fibrils partly terminate in 
      focal adhesion-sites and rather seem to serve a cytoskeletal than a contractile 
      function.

TI  - Control of mitotic synchrony in Physarum polycephalum. Phase shifting by fusion of 
      heterophasic plasmodia contradicts a limit cycle oscillator model.
PG  - 175-9
AB  - Fusion of two multinuclear plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum representing different 
      stages of the mitotic cycle causes a rapid mitotic synchronization of "young" (A) 
      and "old" (B) nuclei [2, 14, 19]. This communication reveals that even at large 
      phase differences synchronization always occurs by advancing "young" and retarding 
      "old" nuclei. This strongly contradicts a limit cycle oscillator model [8] which 
      would permit synchronization on the shorter arc of the phase circle (advancing B and 
      retarding A) at phase differences larger than 1/2 of the cycle. Density labelling of 
      newly synthesized DNA in mixed plasmodia with BdUrd indicates that G2-nuclei become 
      irreversibly committed for mitosis and DNA synthesis at a transition point located 
      within only a few minutes of the visible onset of chromosome condensation.

TI  - Melanin biosynthesis during differentiation of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 148-55
AB  - Melanin synthesis in the myxomycete Physarum polycephalum occurs during sporulation 
      but not during spherule formation. Melanin-like pigment was extracted from spores. 
      An almost identical substance of polyphenols was extracted from spherules and 
      characterized by its ultraviolet and infrared absorbance spectra. Polyphenol oxidase 
      activity in spherules was very low and showed only one weak isoenzyme band in 
      isoelectric focusing polyacrylamide gels. A much higher activity, and an increasing 
      number of isoenzymes, were detected in sporulating cultures after illumination 
      during the differentiation process. The addition of melanin precursors resulted in 
      the synthesis of brownish-yellow spherules, probably containing dopachrome, whereas 
      the addition of polyphenol oxidase inhibitors resulted in yellow sporangia. The 
      results indicate that melanin synthesis is probably only a stage in maturation but 
      not an essential part of the morphogenetic process itself.

      metabolism of the myxomycete Physarum polycephalum. J. Bacteriol. 92:1028-1035. 
      1966.-Previous studies have shown that Physarum polycephalum requires exogenous 
      methionine for growth, but not cysteine, folic acid, or vitamin B(12). Methionine 
      can also serve as the sole source of sulfur for all cellular requirements, without 
      limiting the growth rate. S-methyl-l-cysteine, 2-hydroxy-4-methiol butyric acid, 
      S-adenosyl-l-methionine, and methionine peptides were the only compounds supporting 
      growth, when substituted for methionine. Other methionine analogues, methyl donors 
      in combination with homocysteine, and intermediates of the cystathionine pathway 
      were not active. Ethionine and S-ethyl cysteine were good methionine antagonists. 
      This myxomycete is apparently unable to synthesize the methyl or S-methyl group, 
      although it still appears able to transmethylate, at least from S-methyl cysteine, 
      and probably from S-adenosyl methionine, which can also serve as a source of 
      adenine.

TI  - Model of the Ca2+ oscillator for shuttle streaming in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 368-80
AB  - We propose a mechanism for the cytoplasmic Ca++ oscillator which is thought to power 
      shuttle streaming in strands of the slime-mold Physarum polycephalum. The mechanism 
      uses a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle of myosin light chain kinase. This 
      kinase is bistable if the kinase phosphorylation chain, through adenylate cyclase 
      and cAMP, is activated by calcium. Relaxation oscillations can then occur if calcium 
      is exchanged between the cytoplasm and internal vacuoles known to exist in physarum. 
      As contractile activity in physarum myosin is inhibited by calcium, this model can 
      give calcium oscillations 180 degrees out of phase with actin filament tension as 
      observed. Oscillations of ATP concentration are correctly predicted to be in phase 
      with the tension, provided the actomyosin cycling rate is comparable with ATPase 
      rates for phosphorylation of the myosin light chain and its kinase.

TI  - Effects of the free radical generator paraquat on differentiation, superoxide 
      dismutase, glutathione and inorganic peroxides in microplasmodia of Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 623-30
AB  - The herbicide paraquat was used to investigate the effects of oxidative stress on 
      the spherulation of Physarum polycephalum microplasmodia. The responses of a white 
      non-differentiating strain of Physarum were compared with those of a common yellow 
      strain that readily spherulates in salts-only starvation medium. The addition of 
      paraquat to the salts medium increased the specific activity of superoxide dismutase 
      in both strains; it also induced an increase in the intracellular inorganic peroxide 
      concentration in both strains. Glutathione concentration was higher in the 
      paraquat-treated yellow strain than in the controls. Paraquat had no effect on 
      glutathione concentration in white microplasmodia. Paraquat accelerated spherulation 
      in yellow microplasmodia. The white microplasmodia responded to the herbicide by 
      cleaving into structures similar to immature spherules; however, these structures 
      were not viable. The results of this study support the hypothesis that free radicals 
      are involved in cell state transitions.

TI  - Arginine synthesis and nitrogen excretion in the myxomycete Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 492-5
AB  - The nitrogen excretory metabolism of the myxomycete Physarum polycephalum was 
      studied. When cultured in partially defined broth medium or on agar, the principal 
      excretory product was ammonia nitrogen. A small, variable quantity of urea was 
      excreted in liquid culture. No uric acid or other purines were detected in the 
      cultures. When microplasmodia were incubated with sodium [14C]bicarbonate, 
      radioisotope was incorporated into citrulline, arginine, and urea. Incubation with 
      L-[carbamoyl-14C]citrulline yielded labelled arginine, urea, and CO2. Substantial 
      urease activity was found in extracts of the microplasmodia. These results, in 
      conjunction with the lack of an absolute nutritional requirement for arginine, 
      provide evidence that Physarum has a functional arginine biosynthetic pathway, an 
      arginase, and a urease.

TI  - Kinetics of nuclease digestion of Physarum polycephalum nuclei at different stages 
      of the cell cycle.
PG  - 423-31
AB  - The kinetics of nuclease digestion of Physarum polycephalum nuclei by staphylococcal 
      nuclease and DNase I has been studied at different stages of the cell cycle. 
      Significant differences in the digestion behaviour of nuclei from metaphase and 
      interphase have been detected with DNase I but not with staphylococcal nuclease. 
      Furthermore the structure of newly replicated DNA in S phase differs from the bulk 
      in that it is more easily degraded to acid-soluble products by either staphylococcal 
      nuclease or by DNAase I. At least four types of chromatin structure can be 
      distinguished by our digestion kinetics experiments.

TI  - Change in zeta potential and membrane potential of slime mold Physarum polycephalum 
      in response to chemical stimuli.
PG  - 73-80
AB  - Electrophoretic study of microplasmodia of the true slime mold Physarum polycephalum 
      was carried out in the presence of various concentrations of inorganic salts, 
      nucleotides and sugars, and the zeta potential at the surface of the plasmodia was 
      determined from the electrophoretic mobilities. The membrane potential of the 
      plasmodia was also measured under the same external conditions. It was shown that 
      changes in the membrane potential induced by the chemical stimuli agreed 
      approximately with those induced in the zeta potential in all cases examined. These 
      results suggested that the phase boundary potential at the membrane-solution 
      interface is mainly responsible for the membrane potential in the chemoreception of 
      the slime mold.

TI  - Aminopeptidases of Physarum polycephalum. Activity, isoenzyme pattern, and synthesis 
      during differentiation.
PG  - 7420-7
AB  - In extracts from both growing and differentiating (spherulating) plasmodia of the 
      true slime mold Physarum polycephalum, high aminopeptidase activities were found. 
      The specificity of the aminopeptidases changed during differentiation with a higher 
      relative activity towards hydrophobic NH2-terminal amino acids. This change in 
      specificity was found to be the result of a shift in the isoenzyme spectrum during 
      differentiation as was tested by isoelectric focusing in sucrose gradients. Three 
      different classes of isoenzymes were found: one band which was present in both 
      growing and differentiating cultures; two bands which were found only in growing 
      cultures; and four bands which were detectable only in differentiating plasmodia. If 
      cycloheximide was applied during the induction of differentiation, only one band, 
      the one present in both types of plasmodia, was found in the isoelectric focusing. 
      Density labeling experiments using deuterated amino acids revealed that the bands 
      which are present in differentiated plasmodia only are synthesized de novo during 
      this differentiation.

TI  - Covalent linkage between RNA and nascent DNA in the slime mold, Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 410-20
AB  - When alpha--32 P-labeled deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates are injected into 
      plasmodia of the eukaryotic slime mold, Physarum polycephalum, they are incorporated 
      initially into strands of DNA which are mostly less than 300 nucleotides long. Sixty 
      minutes after injection incorporated deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates are found in 
      much longer strands. If the short strands found two minutes after injection are 
      denatured and centrifuged to equilibrium in a Cs(2)SO(4) density gradient, they 
      migrate to a density slightly greater than that of single-stranded Physarum DNA. 
      When these short strands are treated with alkali to hydrolyze RNA, a small fraction 
      of the incorporated -32P is made acid-soluble and is identified as a mixture of the 
      four ribonucleoside 2',3'-monophosphates. Such transfer of -32P to ribonucleotides 
      occurs when any of the 4 alpha--32P-labeled deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates is 
      used for injection, but the transfer is greatest with [alpha--32P]dGTP. We conclude 
      that very short stretches of RNA are found linked through phosphodiester bonds to 
      nascent DNA chains in Physarum polycephalum and that any of the 16 possible 
      combinations of ribo- and deoxyribonucleotides can occur at the RNA-DNA junction.

TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the Physarum polycephalum small subunit ribosomal RNA as 
      inferred from the gene sequence: secondary structure and evolutionary implications.
PG  - 265-73
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the Physarum polycephalum small subunit ribosomal RNA 
      (SSU rRNA) gene has been determined. Sequence data indicate that the mature 19S SSU 
      rRNA is 1,964 nucleotides long. A complete secondary structure model for P. 
      polycephalum SSU rRNA has been constructed on the basis of the Escherichia coli 16S 
      rRNA model and data from comparative analyses of 28 different eukaryotic sequences. 
      A "four-helix" model is presented for the central domain variable region. This model 
      can be applied both to vertebrate and most lower eukaryotic SSU rRNAs. The increased 
      size of P. polycephalum SSU rRNA relative to the smaller SSU rRNAs from such other 
      lower eukaryotes, as Dictyostelium, Tetrahymena or Saccharomyces is due mainly to 
      three G+C-rich insertions found in two regions known to be of variable length in 
      eukaryotes. In a phylogenetic tree constructed from pairwise comparisons of 
      eukaryotic SSU rRNA sequences, the acellular myxomycete P. polycephalum is seen to 
      diverge before the appearance of the cellular myxomycete Dictyostelium discoideum.

TI  - Ribosomal DNA in spores of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 118-24
AB  - DNA was isolated from plasmodia, spores and newly hatched amoebae of the slime mould 
      Physarum polycephalum. The DNA preparations were fractionated in CsCl gradients and 
      each fraction hybridised to combined 19 S + 26 S rRNA. In all three DNA preparations 
      hybridisation was found to be limited to satellite DNA (rho = 1.714 g/cm3) and at 
      saturation was found to reach a level of 0.16--0.18 % of total DNA. The main band of 
      nuclear DNA (rho = 1.702 g/cm3) did not hybridise appreciably. Further experiments 
      using analytical CsCl gradients revealed that the ratio of satellite to main band 
      DNA was similar in all three preparations. It is concluded that the genes for 
      ribosomal RNA are equally reiterated in spores, hatching amoebae and in plasmodia. 
      They appear to be similarly organised in all stages of the life cycle examined so

TI  - Magnetic nanoparticles-loaded Physarum polycephalum: Directed growth and particles 
      distribution.
AB  - Slime mold Physarum polycephalum is a single cell visible by an unaided eye. The 
      slime mold optimizes its network of protoplasmic tubes to minimize expose to 
      repellents and maximize expose to attractants and to make efficient transportation 
      of nutrients. These properties of P. polycephalum, together with simplicity of its 
      handling and culturing, make it a priceless substrate for designing novel sensing, 
      computing and actuating architectures in living amorphous biological substrate. We 
      demonstrate that, by loading Physarum with magnetic particles and positioning it in 
      a magnetic field, we can, in principle, impose analog control procedures to 
      precisely route active growing zones of slime mold and shape topology of its 
      protoplasmic networks.

TI  - Regions in the ribosomal minichromosome of Physarum polycephalum are protected from 
      restriction nucleases; protection is insensitive to high salt in the G phase and 
      sensitive in the M phase of the cell cycle.
PG  - 651-66
AB  - In the central spacer region of the extrachromosomal ribosomal DNA of the slime mold 
      Physarum polycephalum, four small regions of related sequence are completely 
      inaccessible to restriction endonucleases (HinfI and MboI). In addition, some 
      sequences neighboring the inaccessible ones, are partially inaccessible to 
      restriction enzymes and micrococcal nuclease. Taking advantage of the natural 
      synchrony of Physarum plasmodia, we found that this protection is present throughout 
      the cell cycle. Treatment with high salt (2.5 M-NaCl) of nuclei from the G2 phase of 
      the cell cycle left the protection essentially unchanged. When nuclei from the M 
      phase were treated with salt, the protection was abolished. The inaccessible sites 
      are located close to the origins of replication of the rDNA.

TI  - Phosphorylation of ribosomal proteins during the cell cycle of Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 211-3
AB  - Physarum polycephalum has been used as a model system to study the phosphorylation 
      of ribosomal proteins during the cell cycle. The results showed that the phosphate 
      content of S3, the major ribosomal phosphoprotein in this organism, was constant 
      during all phases of the cell cycle. No additional ribosomal phosphoproteins were 
      observed. These results differ significantly from those reported earlier by Rupp, 
      R.G., Humphrey, R.M. and Shaeffer, J.R. (Biochim. Biophys. Acta (1976) 418, 81-92) 
      and suggest that the use of thymidine or hydroxyurea to synchronize cell population 
      may affect the phosphorylation of ribosomal proteins. The results are discussed in 
      relation to protein synthesis and cAMP level during the cell cycle.

      Behaviour of mitochondrial nucleoids throughout mitochondrial division cycle.
PG  - 687-94
AB  - The fine structure of mitochondria and mitochondrial nucleoids in exponentially 
      growing Physarum polycephalum was studied at various periods throughout the 
      mitochondrial division cycle by light and electron microscopy. The mitochondrial 
      nucleoid elongates lingitudinally while the mitochondrion increases in size. When 
      the nucleoid reaches a length of approximately 1.5 mum the mitochondrial membrane 
      invaginates at the center of the mitochondrion and separates the mitochondrial 
      contents. However, the nucleoid does not divide even when the mitochondrial sections 
      are connected by a very narrow bridge. Just before division of the mitochondrion, 
      the nucleoid divides by constriction of the limiting membrane of the dividing 
      mitochondrion. After division, one end of the nucleoid appears to be associated with 
      the inner mitochondrial membrane. The nucleoid then again becomes situated in the 
      center of the mitochondrion before repeating these same processes.

AB  - The malate dehydrogenase isoenzymes from Physarum polycephalum have been purified to

      electrophoresis and analytical ultracentrifugation. Certain physical and chemical 
      parameters of the malate dehydrogenase isoenzymes reported here include 
      sedimentation, molecular weight and subunit molecular weight. Most unique of the 
      differences between the isoenzymes were the widely separate isoelectric points of 
      9.83 for mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase and 6.14 for the supernatant malate 
      dehydrogenase. The amino acid analyses of each form were done revealing the 
      isoenzymes were unquestionably unique proteins differing in the content of ten amino 
      acids.

TI  - Anisomycin sensitive mutants of Physarum polycephalum isolated by cyst selection.
PG  - 253-9
AB  - The haploid myxamoebae of Physarum polycephalum reversibly differentiate to form 
      dormant microcysts under conditions of starvation. The thin-walled cysts can be 
      selective recovered from a cell suspension which has been treated with the 
      surfactant Triton X-100 to lyse amoeboid forms. Excystment, which is initiated by 
      suspension in liquid medium, is inhibited by antibiotics which block protein 
      synthesis. Cysts of drug resistant mutants excyst rapidly in media containing 
      sufficient antibiotic to maintain drug sensitive strains in the encysted state. The 
      selective survival of non-excysted cells following Triton X-100 treatment has been 
      employed to enrich for drug sensitive mutants. Several anisomycin sensitive mutants 
      have been isolated, one of which has been analysed genetically. The possible 
      applications of this mutant enrichment technique are discussed.

TI  - PPRAS1PPRAS2 AND PPRAP1 GENES, MEMBERS OF A RAS GENE FAMILY FROM THE TRUE SLIME MOLD 
      PHYSARUM POLYCEPHALUM ARE DEVELOPMENTALLY REGULATED.
PG  - 441-5
AB  - The expression patterns of two true ras genes, Ppras1 and Ppras2and one rap gene, 
      Pprap1were examined in four Physarum polycephalum developmental stages: uninucleate 
      amoebae, plasmodia (multinucleate syncytia), spherules (a vegetative, dormant stage) 
      and fruiting bodies. Ppras1 and Pprap1 are expressed in all stages examined with the 
      maximum levels of their transcripts in amoebae and fruiting bodies, respectively, 
      and the minimum levels in plasmodia, whereas the Ppras2 transcript is only 
      detectable in amoebae and fruiting bodies. The results obtained indicate that P. 
      polycephalum is an organism possessing a developmentally regulated ras gene family 
      and presents a convenient system to study the role of ras/rap genes in control of 
      growth and differentiation of lower eukaryotic organisms.Copyright 1997 Academic

TI  - Amino acid sequence data of alpha-tubulin from myxamoebae of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 919-24
AB  - About 96% of the amino acid sequence of an alpha-tubulin from the slime mould 
      Physarum polycephalum has been determined. Of 430 sequenced amino acids, 30 differ 
      from the deduced amino acid sequence of a recently published alpha-tubulin 
      complementary DNA from the plasmodial form of P. polycephalum. The myxamoebal 
      alpha-tubulin differs from all other known alpha-tubulins in one of the last three 
      C-terminal amino acids that are Gly-Glu-Tyr instead of the usual Glu-Glu-Tyr. These 
      last three amino acids are preceded by 11 residues that appear to be particularly 
      susceptible to mutation. No heterogeneity was found whilst sequencing the myxamoebal 
      alpha-tubulin, indicating that only one type of alpha-tubulin is present in 
      myxamoebae. This alpha-tubulin appears to be less conserved than the previously 
      described plasmodial alpha-tubulin, supporting the hypothesis that the structural 
      constraints on tubulin in axonemes have a significant effect on its rate of 
      mutation.

PG  - 25-42
AB  - The present study has been mainly focused on the nucleolar cycle in the slime mould 
      Physarum polycephalum. The ultrastructural characteristics of the interphase 
      nucleolus, in this species, are quite similar to those of nucleoli in other 
      organisms: it is essentially constituted of large particulate zones surrounding 
      denser regions which are predominantly fibrillar in texture. The latter nucleolar 
      zones, following fixation with osmium tetroxide, are characterized by the presence 
      of opaque granules approximately 25 nm in diameter. Contrary to the situation which 
      generally prevails in other eukaryotes, the late prophase nucleolus fragments into 
      numerous globular bodies which are recognizable by the presence of opaque particles. 
      These fibrillogranular nucleolar fragments persist during mitosis and are observed 
      to become incorporated in the newly formed nucleolus. High-resolution 
      radioautographic observations reveal that these nucleolar remnants contain DNA. The 
      present observations together with recent biochemical data from other authors on the 
      characteristics and mode of duplication of nucleolar DNA in P. polycephalum have led 
      us to the hypothesis that the nucleolus, in this organism, contains several distinct 
      globular subunits each containing ribosomal DNA as a key component. The existence of 
      such morphological subunits appears to account for the unusual behaviour of the 
      nucleolus during the cell cycle.

TI  - Selective inhibition of DNA polymerase alpha by a polysaccharide purified from slime 
      of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 61-6
AB  - A polysaccharide was purified from the slime of a myxomycete, Physarum polycephalum, 
      and its inhibitory effect on eukaryotic DNA polymerases was examined. Almost all the 
      calf thymus DNA polymerase alpha activity was inhibited with higher than 0.2 mg/ml 
      of the polysaccharide, when the assay was carried out with activated DNA as a 
      template. The inhibitory effect occurred regardless of the amounts of the enzyme and 
      deoxyribonucleotides, however, kinetic analysis revealed that the inhibition occurs 
      competitively with the template DNA, the Ki value being 4 micrograms/ml. Inhibition 
      was observed for DNA polymerase alpha, but not for DNA polymerases beta and gamma 
      from various eukaryote species.

TI  - Turnover rates of phosphoryl groups in ribosomal proteins of Physarum polycephalum. 
      Evidence for two different mechanisms.
PG  - 143-8
AB  - The rate of phosphate exchange in individual ribosomal proteins of Physarum 
      polycephalum was determined in vivo. It was observed that the phosphoryl groups of 
      S3, the major phosphoprotein, had a turnover rate of 1.5% per minute. The phosphoryl 
      groups of proteins L1, L20 and L24 were stable. These results show that the 
      phosphorylation of ribosomal proteins is regulated by at least two different 
      mechanisms. The rapid turnover of phosphoryl groups of the major phosphoprotein is 
      in agreement with the general observation that the phosphate content of this protein 
      is modulated by the physiological state of the cells and possibly involved in the 
      regulation of ribosome activity. The absence of phosphate exchange in acidic 
      proteins suggests that these groups could play a structural role in the ribosome 
      functions.

PG  - 76-86
AB  - A substance has been purified from isolated nuclei of Physarum polycephalum by 
      equilibrium and velocity gradient centrifugations, ion exchange chromatography and 
      gel filtration which has a high molecular weight, can be labeled in vivo with 32P, 
      is heat stable and resistant to amylases, proteases, nucleases and phosphodiesterase 
      but is sensitive to phosphatases or hydrolysis. This material consists of phosphate 
      and glycerol. It selectively inhibits in vitro transcription of RNA polymerases, 
      predominantly the homologous enzyme A by binding to the enzyme. In the presence of 
      this inhibitor of transcription a stable RNA polymerase-template complex cannot be 
      formed. Binding to and inactivation of RNA polymerase is reversible at high ionic 
      strength.

AB  - Synchronous plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum were pulse-labeled with 3H-thymidine 
      in early or late portions of the S-phase, and the binding capacity of the replicated 
      DNA for isochronous S-phase plasmodial proteins assessed by nitrocellulose filter 
      binding assay. Replication units replicating during the first one-third of the 
      S-phase preferentially bind cytosol proteins present in plasmodia engaged in early S 
      DNA replication, while late S replicating DNA exhibits a corresponding preferential 
      binding of plasmodial proteins present only in late S plasmodia. 
      Temporally-characteristic nascent replication units were isolated by Hydroxylapatite 
      column chromatography and were found to contain binding sites for isochronous 
      proteins.

TI  - Change in ATP-pyrophosphohydrolase activity during spherule formation of Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 195-202
AB  - The activity of Ca2+-dependent ATP pyrophosphohydrolase was found to fluctuate 
      during spherule formation of the acellular slime mold Physarum polycephalum under 
      starving incubation. The enzyme activity increased up to 16-fold at the 3rd day of 
      the starvation, then decreased drastically to less than its original level. Column 
      chromatography of the enzyme preparation suggested that the increase in the activity 
      was due to de novo synthesis of a new isozyme. Cycloheximide inhibited the 
      synthesis. The two isozymes were different in their Ca2+ sensitivity, the new one 
      being less sensitive.

      showed that there are 16 highly homologous regions in the sequences of Physarum and 
      E. coli and that eukaryotes have some eukaryote-specific extra sequences. The 
      sequence immediately following the 5.8S-like region of E. coli 23S rRNA was found to 
      be highly homologous to the 5' terminus of Physarum 26S rRNA, indicating that the 
      eukaryote-specific 5.8S rRNA gene is derived from the 5'-terminal region of the 
      prokaryote large rRNA gene.

AB  - A nuclear framework structure has been obtained from isolated interphase nuclei of 
      Physarum polycephalum by extraction with 2.5 M NaCl and subsequent digestion with 
      DNase. Whole-mount electron micrographs showed a nuclear lamina containing residual 
      pore structures associated with the fibrous internal matrix. The matrix was 
      continuous with fibrillar remnants of the nucleolus. The structure was shown to 
      consist of 2 major polypeptides of 23,000 and 36,500 Daltons as well as 30 to 40 
      minor polypeptides of various molecular weight classes. The 2 major polypeptides 
      were also prominent in preparations of the residual nucleolar material, suggesting 
      that matrix proteins are common to both structures. The predominance of 
      low-molecular-weight polypeptides in Physarum nuclear matrix suggests that there may 
      be significant differences in composition of nuclear structural proteins between 
      lower and higher eukaryotes.

TI  - The control of mitosis in Physarum polycephalum: the effect of delaying mitosis and 
      evidence for the operation of the control mechanism in the absence of growth.
PG  - 59-65
AB  - Possible mechanisms coordinating the control of mitosis and DNA synthesis with 
      growth were experimentally tested in Physarum polycephalum by the response of 
      plasmodia to 2 different kinds of perturbation of the DNA:mass ratio. Mitosis and 
      DNA synthesis were delayed without stopping growth either by the use of 
      fluorodeoxyuridine (FUdR) or puromycin, in both cases the delayed mitosis was 
      followed by a single shortened intermitotic period, as predicted by all the 
      mechanisms considered and substantiating a basic assumption made that the time of 
      mitosis is homeostatically controlled to maintain a constant DNA:mass ratio. When 
      more than 50% of the DNA was destroyed by ultraviolet irradiation 2 consecutive 
      mitoses could occur even when growth was completely stopped by starvation. This 
      result can only be accounted for by 2 of the 5 models considered, a finding which 
      agrees with the results of previous experiments which were also consistent with only 
      these 2 mechanisms.

TI  - Role of mRNA 5'-terminal caps in translational dormancy of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 469-76
AB  - Translational regulation of protein synthesis accompanies sclerotization in Physarum 
      polycephalum. Plasmodial and sclerotial poly(A)+ RNA were translated in a 
      message-dependent wheat germ lysate in the presence of the cap analogue 
      7-methylguanosine-triphosphate to determine whether 5' structural alterations in 
      mRNA accompany translational repression. The translation of plasmodial and 
      sclerotial poly(A)+ RNA was reduced to identical levels suggesting that both RNA 
      populations are capped. The 5'-termini of plasmodial and sclerotial poly(A)+ RNA 
      were identified as m7G5'ppp5'Cm. Alterations in the 5'-cap of mRNA during 
      sclerotization do not appear to be responsible for translational dormancy.

TI  - A cytoplasmic inhibitor of DNA polymerase from the plasmodia of Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 735-41
AB  - A factor which inhibited DNA polymerase [EC 2.7.7.7] activity was isolated from the 
      cytoplasm of plasmodia of true slime mold, Physarum polycephalum. This factor was 
      purified by DEAE-Sephadex and CM-cellulose column chromatographies, heat treatment 
      and gel filtration. This inhibitor was heat-stable, insensitive to trypsin [EC 
      3.4.21.4] and was not digested by RNase [EC 3.1.4.22] or DNase [EC 3.1.4.5]. The 
      molecular weight was 16,000 as determined by gel filtration, and the isoelectric 
      point was determined to be pH 10.1. In the presence of the inhibitor, Km for DNA in 
      the DNA polymerizing reaction was markedly increased. The inhibitory effect was 
      eliminated by addition of excess DNA, but the addition of excess enzyme or 
      deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates had no effect on the inhibition.

TI  - Blue-light receptor in a white mutant of Physarum polycephalum mediates inhibition 
      of spherulation and regulation of glucose metabolism.
PG  - 1009-13
AB  - Blue light induces sporulation of Physarum polycephalum macroplasmodia and 
      reversibly inhibits spherulation (sclerotization) of microplasmodia. Illuminated 
      microplasmodia have an abnormal appearance. The photobiological responses of the 
      plasmodia appear to be unaffected by the absence of yellow pigment in the white 
      mutant strain used. Illumination of microplasmodial suspensions with blue light 
      (lambda max approximately 465 nm) results also in an early effect on glucose 
      metabolism: glucose consumption is reversibly inhibited. By using radioactive 
      glucose it was shown that the main products formed are a water-insoluble glucan and 
      the disaccharide trehalose. Inhibition of glucose consumption in the light results 
      in decreased production of these two compounds. Illumination of microplasmodial 
      suspensions also causes a reversible effect on the pH of the medium which is 
      interpreted as a decreased production of a yet unidentified acid from glucose. The 
      action spectrum of the light-induced pH response shows maxima near 390, 465, and 485 
      nm. It resembles the absorption spectrum of a flavoprotein and confirms the 
      existence of a blue-light receptor in P. polycephalum microplasmodia.

TI  - Coordinate replication of dispersed repetitive sequences in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 505-17
AB  - The synchronous macroplasmodial growth phase of the slime mould Physarum 
      polycephalum was used to study the in vivo replication of large chromosomal DNA 
      segments. Newly replicated DNA was isolated at various points in S-phase by its 
      preferential association with the nuclear matrix. This DNA was then used to probe 
      cosmid clones of the Physarum genome. The results indicate that certain dispersed 
      repetitive sequences in the genome are coordinately replicated. The observed pattern 
      of replication may be due either to the presence of a replication origin within each 
      repetitive sequence or to the systematic arrangement of these sequences around a 
      replication origin. The latter appears more likely since the repetitive sequences 
      are probably not randomly scattered within the genome.

TI  - Specific nuclear elimination in polyploid plasmodia of the slime mold Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 261-5
AB  - In growing plasmodia of the myxomycete Physarum polycephalum (G2-phase), three 
      distinct classes of nuclei with a relative DNA content of 1x, 2x, and 4x are 
      observed in the presumed haploid strain CL. The 2x and 4x species comprise up to 35% 
      and 5% of the nuclei. Quantitative cytofluorometric studies of nuclei isolated in 
      either G2- or S-phase or after FUDR treatment (G1 arrest) show that the three 
      nuclear populations undergo a synchronous mitotic cycle and that the relative DNA 
      content of the nuclear fractions in G-2 phase reflects the 2c, 4c, and 8c state. The 
      heterogeneity of the nuclear population does, however, seem to be restricted to the 
      growth phase. During a starvation period of 4 days that always preceeds sporulation 
      (and also meiosis), the 4c nuclear population is reduced to 7%, 8c nuclei are no 
      longer detected. These results suggest that a mechanism exists in Physarum for the 
      selective detection and elimination of polyploid nuclei.

TI  - Sequence organization in nuclear deoxyribonucleic acid from Physarum polycephalum. 
      Physical properties of foldback sequences.
PG  - 105-13
AB  - An investigation was performed with the use of physical techniques, to determine the 
      nature and organization of inverted repeat sequences in nuclear DNA fragments from 
      Physarum polycephalum. From the average size of foldback duplexes (550 nucleotide 
      pairs), and the foldback duplex yield as determined by treatment of DNA with S1 
      deoxyribonuclease followed by hydroxyapatite chromatography, it is estimated that 
      there are at least 25000 foldback sequences in the Physarum genome. Foldback DNA 
      molecules exhibit properties intermediate between single-stranded DNA and native 
      duplexes on elution from hydroxyapatite with a salt gradient. In addition, 
      thermal-elution chromatography of foldback DNA from hydroxyapatite crystals shows 
      that foldback duplexes are less stable than native DNA. These properties can be 
      explained on the basis that inverted repeat sequences are mismatched when in the 
      foldback configuration. The results of experiments in which the binding of foldback 
      DNA molecules to hydroxyapatite was determined, by using fragments of different 
      single-chain size, agree with previous studies indicating that inverted repeat 
      sequences are located, on average, every 7000 residues throughout the Physarum 
      genome. The inverted repeats are derived from both the repetitive and single-copy 
      components in Physarum nuclear DNA.

TI  - Replication timing of the H4 histone genes in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 6475-9
AB  - The time of replication of the two H4 histone genes (H41 and H42) was determined 
      during the naturally synchronous mitotic cycle of Physarum polycephalum. 
      5-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine labeling and density gradient centrifugation was used to 
      isolate newly synthesized DNA from defined periods of S phase. The DNA was analyzed 
      by Southern hybridization with a cloned probe containing one of the H4 histone genes 
      of Physarum. The results indicate that the two H4 histone genes are replicated in 
      the first 30 min of S phase but not exactly at the same time. H41 is replicated 
      during the first 10 min of S phase, when only 15% of the genome is duplicated, 
      whereas H42 replicates between 20 and 30 min after the onset of S phase. The 
      possible relationship between the periodic expression of the genes and the timing of 
      their replication is discussed.

TI  - A New Mating Compatibility Locus in PHYSARUM POLYCEPHALUM.
PG  - 683-93
AB  - The rate and extent of plasmodium formation were studied in mating tests involving 
      pairs of largely isogenic amoebal strains compatible for mating-type (mt) alleles. A 
      systematic variability was observed: plasmodia formed either rapidly and extensively 
      or slowly and inefficiently. Plasmodium formation was found to be 10(3)- to 
      10(4)-fold more extensive in "rapid" crosses than in "slow" crosses. A genetic 
      analysis revealed that the variability reflects the influence of a multiallelic 
      compatibility locus that determines mating efficiency. This compatibility locus 
      (designated matB), together with the original mating type locus, mt (in this work 
      designated matA), constitute a tetrapolar mating specificity system in Physarum 
      polycephalum.

TI  - Differences in the surface properties of the mating types of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 248-50
AB  - In the slime mold Physarum polycephalum, formation of a diploid plasmodium occurs 
      when compatible haploid amoebae fuse. To study cell surface changes associated with 
      the fusion process, a non-destructive method known as aqueous, two-phase 
      partitioning was employed. Using a two-phase system of dextran and polyethylene 
      glycol, we observed that the two mating types (RSD4 and MA185) have different 
      partition coefficients and hence different surface properties. Based on their 
      partitioning behavior, MA185 cells appear to have a more hydrophobic surface than 
      RSD4 amoeba. The partition coefficient of both cell types decreased with time. If 
      amoebae were maintained in culture until they encysted, differences in their surface 
      were not detectable.

AB  - The effect of calcium ions on the reactivation of cytoplasmic actomyosin contraction 
      in cell-free models of endoplasmic drops from Physarum polycephalum after glycerol 
      extraction at low ionic strength depends on the duration of the extraction 
      procedure: Ca++ prevents contraction in 20-h extracted specimens, whereas after 
      several days of extraction this Ca++-sensitivity is lost. These results indicate an 
      inhibitory effect of Ca++ on cytoplasmic actomyosin contraction.

TI  - DNA replication in Physarum polycephalum: electron microscopic analysis of patterns 
      of DNA replication in the presence of cycloheximide.
PG  - 323-31
AB  - DNA from synchronously replicating nuclei of Physarum polycephalum was studied 
      electron microscopically after 15, 30, 60, and 90 or 120 min of replication in the 
      presence or absence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. The 
      replication-loop size-distribution showed that replication fork progression is 
      severely retarded in the presence of cycloheximide. Analysis of replication-loop 
      frequency showed a similar pattern in control and cyclo-heximide-treated samples, 
      with an increase from 15 to 30 and 60 min. This suggests, surprisingly, that 
      initiations of new replicons either may not be inhibited by cycloheximide or, 
      alternatively, that all initiations have already taken place at the very start of 
      S-phase. The latter conclusion is favored in the light of previous results in our 
      laboratory, discussed here.

TI  - Microtubule nucleation by the isolated microtubule-organizing centre of Physarum 
      polycephalum myxamoebae.
PG  - 365-81
AB  - The nucleus--centrosome complex from Physarum polycephalum myxamoebae has been 
      purified. The complex contained the centriole pair and pericentriolar material in 
      association with the nucleus. Apart from some unusually stable microtubules, which 
      appeared to be involved in maintaining the nucleus-centrosome association, 
      endogenous microtubule arrays had been stripped from the complex during isolation. 
      When the nucleus--centrosome complex was incubated with purified brain or myxamoebal 
      tubulins the growth of 45-70 microtubules was initiated onto the pericentriolar 
      material. The number and length of the nucleated microtubules was proportional to 
      the tubulin concentration. Pretreatment of the nucleus--centrosome complex with 
      DNase 1, RNase A, antitubulin antibody and anticentriolar antibody did not affect 
      pericentriolar nucleation capacity, although pretreatment with DNase 1 did expose 
      perinuclear nucleation sites that had a much lower minimal tubulin concentration for 
      assembly than the pericentriolar site. After pretreatment with trypsin 
      pericentriolar material and nucleation were destroyed, and microtubule elongation 
      occurred directly onto the centriole microtubules.

AB  - The distinctive properties of satellite DNA molecules containing the genes for 
      ribosomal RNA in Physarum polycephalum permits their identification in total, 
      unfractionated nuclear DNA in the foldback form, after denaturation and fast 
      annealing. Using the electron microscope the location and properties of three 
      characteristic regions containing tandemly-repeated, inverted sequences have been 
      investigated. At least two additional regions, also containing tandem repeats, are 
      shown to be present and located towards each end of the rDNA molecule, at a site 
      adjacent to the segment coding for the 26 S rRNA. All the regions which contain 
      tandem repeats are composed of sequences which, within experimental error, appear to 
      share a common unit repeat length of about 90 nucleotides.

TI  - Isolation of a minichromosome containing the ribosomal genes from Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 484-90
AB  - The ribosomal genes of Physarum polycephalum are located on linear DNA molecules 
      (rDNA) of 38 x 10(6) daltons present in each nucleolus in 100--200 copies. The rDNA 
      is not part of the large chromosomal DNA. These molecules have now been solubilized 
      in the form of transcriptionally active deoxyribonucleoprotein complexes from 
      nucleoli purified through Percoll gradients. The ribosomal chromatin (rDNP) 
      sediments in sucrose gradients as a homogeneous fraction with an approximate 
      sedimentation coefficient of 100 S. It contains alpha-amanitin-resistant RNA 
      polymerase I activity and rDNA as its major (or sole) DNA component. Buoyant density 
      analysis indicates that ribosomal chromatin contains, besides RNA polymerase I, 
      significant amounts of additional protein. RNA synthesized in vitro by the 
      endogenous RNA polymerase is complementary to rDNA and is transcribed mainly from 
      the sequences coding for 19S and 26S ribosomal RNA.

TI  - Changes in activity and subcellular localization of alpha-like DNA polymerase during 
      cell cycle of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 581-8
AB  - Regulation of DNA replication was given attention by examining the subcellular 
      localization of alpha-like DNA polymerase in Physarum polycephalum. The activity per 
      plasmodium increased by 2-fold in the cytoplasm during the G2-phase, and decreased 
      with a concomitant increase in nuclei prior to DNA replication. This would suggest 
      that the enzyme translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, co-ordinately with 
      DNA replication. In nuclei, the nuclear matrix-bound activity increased during the 
      S-phase, but changes did not always parallel the rate of DNA replication. On the 
      other hand, the activity measured without exogenous templates did change with the 
      rate, although the activity was low. It is, therefore, suggested that part of the 
      enzyme binding with the matrix participates in DNA replication.

TI  - Cell cycle-dependent variations in RNA polymerase activity in the nuclear and 
      cytoplasmic fractions of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 55-62
AB  - The RNA polymerase activities of the soluble enzymes from the nuclear and 
      cytoplasmic fractions from synchronous macroplasmodia of Physarum polycephalum were 
      measured. Activity in the nuclear fraction prepared from cells in the G2 phase was 
      several times higher than that at metaphase, and activity in the cytoplasmic 
      fraction was much higher at metaphase than in the G2 phase. The amount of activity 
      was nearly constant during the late G2 phase and early prophase, then rose abruptly 
      just before metaphase, becoming tenfold higher at metaphase then decreasing rapidly 
      during anaphase-telophase. The cytoplasmic activity at metaphase was attributed 
      almost exclusively to the type II (or B) enzyme as shown by alpha-amanitin 
      inhibition and chromatographic analysis of the enzyme. Results indicate that at 
      metaphase RNA polymerase II molecules are loosely associated with condensed 
      chromosomes or that they move from the mitotic nuclei into the cytoplasm.

TI  - Enrichment of fibrillar cytoplasmic actomyosin in protoplasmic strands of Physarum 
      polycephalum for the production of cell-free models.
PG  - 365-74
AB  - The treatment of isolated protoplasmic strands of Physarum polycephalum with 2.5% 
      ethanol in a physiological salt solution under isometric conditions induces the 
      formation of a large amount of mostly longitudinally organized actomyosin fibrils in 
      the endoplasmic channel, a region normally free of actomyosin fibrils. The quantity 
      of fibrillogenesis as well as the concomitant force output during the induced 
      contractures are dependent on the Ca++-content and the temperature of the test 
      solution. The method was developed to optimize the structure of the plasmodial 
      strands before their subsequent transformation into cell-free models by 
      permeabilization and extraction of the strands. Cryosections of plasmodial strands 
      containing cytoplasmic actomyosin fibrils stained with fluorescently labeled 
      phallotoxins offer a further assay for the study of their contraction physiology 
      under cell-free conditions.

TI  - The isolation of nuclei containing mitotic spindles from the plasmodium of the slime 
      mould Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 52-9
AB  - We have developed a protocol which facilitates the isolation of nuclei containing 
      mitotic spindles from the plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum. The nuclei are 
      isolated in a spindle stabilization buffer (SSB) consisting of -4 M glycerol, 5 mM 
      EGTA, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM PIPES and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 at pH 6.5. Isolation at 
      20 degrees C, chelation of Ca2+ and the inclusion of the 4 M glycerol were found to 
      be essential for stabilization of the spindle microtubules. The method allows the 
      isolation of clean nuclei in a reasonable yield. Nuclei were isolated at each of the 
      main stages of mitosis (prophase, metaphase and anaphase) and transmission electron 
      microscopy of the isolated nuclei revealed well preserved arrangements of spindle 
      microtubules which were characteristic of the particular stage of mitosis.

TI  - Analysis of foldback sequences and repetitive sequences in cloned segments of 
      nuclear DNA from Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 89-100
AB  - The properties of DNA segments containing foldback elements were studied after their 
      selection from a "random" recombinant library of Physarum polycephalum nuclear DNA 
      sequences, cloned using the plasmid vector pBR322. Hybridisation of in vitro 
      labelled recombinant plasmids to Southern blots of genomic restriction fragments 
      demonstrated that each cloned segment contained repetitive elements located at 
      several hundred sites in the genome. Two of the DNA clones generated hybridisation 
      patterns which suggested that they contain repetitive elements with internal 
      cleavage sites for the restriction endonuclease HaeIII. Cross-hybridisation of all 
      combinations of the cloned sequences showed that most contain different arrangements 
      of repetitive elements derived from different sequence families. The results are 
      consistent with a model proposed previously on the basis of studies on total nuclear 
      DNA, for the organisation of sequences closely associated with foldback elements in 
      the Physarum genome.

AB  - The effect of ageing on the properties of polysomal poly(A)-containing messenger RNA 
      [poly(A)+ mRNA] of Physarum polycephalum has been investigated. Using 
      poly(U)--Sepharose affinity chromatography it was shown that shortening of the 
      poly(A) tract occurred as the age of the mRNA population increased. Analysis of the 
      poly(A) segments by use of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, after digestion of 
      polysomal poly(A)+ mRNA molecules with RNAase A and RNAase T1, revealed that their 
      lengths ranged from 140 to 220 nucleotide residues. A reduction in the efficiency of 
      utilization of mRNA for translation as the age of the mRNA population increased was 
      demonstrated by measuring the proportion of poly(A)+ mRNA present in the polysomal 
      fraction as compared with post-polysomal material.

      mitosis. Pulses applied in G2 cause a delay of mitosis which is linearly dependent 
      on the phase in the cell cycle at which the pulse is applied. A 30 min pulse of 10 
      micrograms/ml cycloheximide starting in G2 at time t after mitosis induces an excess 
      delay (delay in excess of pulse duration) of the next mitosis of (0.55) t-1.3 h. The 
      excess delays induced by 7 h pulses during G2 are at most 1 h larger. Pulses applied 
      less than 30 min before mitosis induce only small delays.

TI  - High-density induction of a quiescent cell state in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 179-90
AB  - The non-histone protein complement of Physarum polycephalum changes rapidly when 
      microplasmodia are subjected to conditions of high density. The changes in these 
      proteins induced by high density are similar to the changes observed during 
      starvation-induced encystment. A 50% decrease in DNA synthesis, observed after 7 h 
      of starvation, is observed after only 1 h of high density. High density also results 
      in a decrease in RNA synthesis comparable to decreases induced by prolonged 
      starvation. Total heterochromatin increases in response to either high density or 
      starvation. Increased heterochromatization is preceded by an increase in nuclear 
      actin. Mitochondrial morphology and cytoplasmic organization are also similarly 
      altered by starvation and high density. These observations suggest the possibility 
      of a generalized mechanism for cellular transition from active growth to a 
      non-proliferative cell state.

TI  - Purification of a novel Ca-binding protein that inhibits myosin light chain kinase 
      activity in lower eukaryote Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 564-70
AB  - Myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) was partially purified from the lower eukaryote 
      Physarum polycephalum. The activity to phosphorylate Physarum myosin was maximal in 
      the absence of Ca2+ and decreased with an increase in Ca2+ concentration with a 
      microM-level Kd. The Ca-binding protein contained in the MLCK preparation was 
      purified to homogeneity. The native protein had a molecular mass of 75 kDa, while 
      under denaturing conditions, it was 38 kDa. Ca-dependent changes in the intensities 
      of intrinsic fluorescence showed that the Kd of the protein for Ca2+ was also in the 
      microM-range. Our results suggest that the Ca-binding protein would play a key role 
      in the effects of Ca2+ in the MLCK preparation.

TI  - Methylation is an early and necessary step in the sporulation programme of the slime 
      mold Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 271-5
AB  - Formation of sporangia can be induced in starved macroplasmodia of Physarum 
      polycephalum by illumination. This process of morphogenesis which starts 9 h after 
      the needed period of illumination can be prevented by the competitive inhibitors of 
      methyltransferases S-adenosyl-homocysteine or L-ethionine, applied either directly 
      by microinjection into the plasmodia or by addition to the medium. Because 
      5-azacytidine (aza-C) or 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (aza-dC) also prevent sporulation 
      (in contrast to cytidine, 8-azaguanine (aza-G) or 6-aza-uridine (aza-U) it is 
      suggested that DNA is the substrate for methylation. The injection technique allows 
      one to determine the period of methylation (i.e. between the 3rd and 4th h of the 
      cell differentiation process after the induction by illumination). Based on the 
      correlation between methylation and genome expression, it is suggested that some 
      genes must be repressed by methylation during this period.

TI  - Sporulation competence in Physarum polycephalum CL and the requirement for DNA 
      replication and mitosis.
PG  - 1489-501
AB  - The optimum conditions for sporulation and the requirements for mitosis and DNA 
      replication during the onset of the process have been investigated in plasmodia of 
      the CL strain of Physarum polycephalum. A 72 h period of starvation was necessary 
      before a plasmodium became competent to sporulate on exposure to light. The 
      plasmodium became irreversibly committed to sporulation 4 to 5 h after illumination. 
      The commitment point was related to the time of illumination rather than the 
      duration of starvation. Three periods of DNA synthesis were detected during the 
      initial 24 h of starvation, but in an asporogenous derivative of the CL strain only 
      the first two periods were detected. Inhibition of mitosis with nocodazole or of DNA 
      synthesis with hydroxyurea prevented sporulation. Escape of plasmodia from 
      hydroxyurea inhibition of sporulation coincided with the last detectable period of 
      DNA synthesis, but escape from nocodazole inhibition of sporulation occurred 25 to 
      30 h later.

TI  - Size distribution and maturation of newly replicated DNA through the S and G2 phases 
      of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 1519-26
AB  - The size distribution of newly made DNA and the dynamics of size maturation of 
      progeny DNA molecules were studied in the synchronous S and G2 phases of Physarum 
      polycephalum. Pulse labeling of DNA and analysis of the products on alkaline sucrose 
      gradients showed that synthesis of primary replication units (which will also be 
      referred to as "Okazaki" fragments) occurred throughout the S period. Pulse and 
      pulse-chase experiments revealed a distinct pattern of size maturation. An 
      apparently linear increase in molecular weight of progeny DNA molecules during the 
      first hour of the S phase occurred at a rate of approximately 4-5 X 10(5) daltons 
      per min at 26 degrees C, corresponding to the joining of 6-8 Okazaki fragments. The 
      resulting 35-45S (1.1-2.2 X 10(7) daltons) DNA molecules may correspond to the 
      Physarum "replicon." The further size increases of the newly made DNA appear to 
      occur in steps, possibly reflecting a clustering of isochronous replicons along the 
      chromatide. These observations are discussed with regard to mechanisms of DNA 
      replication and size maturation.

TI  - Rapid disappearance of one parental mitochondrial genotype after isogamous mating in 
      the myxomycete Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 55-9
AB  - Five haploid amoebal strains of the myxomycete Physarum polycephalum, each with a 
      distinct mitochondrial genotype, were crossed in all pairwise combinations. The 
      mitochondrial genotype in the diploid plasmodia resulting from these isogamous 
      matings were found to be transmitted uniparentally. This uniparental inheritance 
      could be arranged in a dominant hierarchical order. Time-course analysis of the 
      presence of mitochondrial genotypes in the zygotes and young developing plasmodia 
      show that elimination of one parental mitochondrial genotype is virtually completed 
      during the first two nuclear cycles in the zygote/differentiating plasmodium. To our 
      knowledge this is the first report indicating an active mechanism involving the 
      degradation of mitochondrial genomes in sexual crosses.

TI  - Isolation and purification of transcriptionally active ribosomal chromatin from the 
      slime mould, Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 18-29
AB  - In the acellular slime mold Physarum polycephalum the ribosomal genes are all 
      located on linear, extrachromosomal DNA molecules which are clustered in the 
      nucleolus. This report describes the isolation and purification of these ribosomal 
      genes as functionally active chromatin particles. Nucleolar lysates are fractionated 
      by gel filtration to remove ribosomal precursors and other soluble material. The 
      ribosomal chromatin is subsequently separated from contaminating nuclear chromatin 
      by a sucrose gradient centrifugation step. This procedure allows the isolation of 
      the ribosomal genes as intact nucleoprotein particles, which are now amenable to a 
      biochemical analysis of their structural and functional properties.

TI  - Morphological aspects of thiophosphorylated and dephosphorylated myosin molecules 
      from the plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 1175-83
AB  - Electron microscopically, the myosin molecule from the plasmodium of Physarum 
      polycephalum has a long tail of 173 nm, having a flexible region over the range of 
      80 to 120 nm from the head-tail junction. In 0.6 M ammonium acetate, this region of 
      the dephosphorylated myosin molecules is more flexible than that of the 
      thiophosphorylated ones. In 50 mM ammonium acetate, the dephosphorylated myosin 
      molecules exist in monomeric and oligomeric forms, independently of ATP and Mg2+, 
      whereas the thiophosphorylated myosin molecules form dense aggregates of thick 
      filaments. The tails of the monomeric dephosphorylated myosin molecules bend sharply 
      at the flexible region at angles of more than 120 degrees. In oligomers of the

      the regulation mechanism of cell motility of the plasmodium is discussed.

TI  - Organisation of genes for ribosomal RNA in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 541-9
AB  - Physarum polycephalum nucleolar satellite DNA has been analysed by restriction 
      enzyme digests and hybridisation to ribosomal RNA. The nucleolar DNA is isolated as 
      molecules of molecular weight 39 X 10(6). The positions of sites of endo R-EcoRI and 
      endo R-HindIII digestion have been determined accurately in the whole molecule. The 
      endo R-EcoRI sites and one endo R-HindIII site are within the26-S rRNA complementary 
      sequence and the other endo R-HindIII site is within the 19-S rRNA complementary 
      sequence. The sites are arranged symmetrically about the centre of the molecule as 
      if it were a palindrome.

TI  - Association of newly replicated DNA with the nuclear matrix of Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 349-63
AB  - We have studied the role of the nuclear matrix in DNA replication in a naturally 
      synchronized eucaryote, Physarum polycephalum. When P. polycephalum. When P. 
      polycephalum macroplasmodia were pulse labeled with 3H-thymidine, the DNA remaining 
      tightly associated with the matrix was highly enriched in newly synthesized DNA. 
      This enrichment was found both in nuclei that had just initiated DNA replication as 
      well as in nuclei isolated later during S phase. Pulse chase experiments showed that 
      the association of newly replicated DNA with the matrix is transient, since most of 
      the newly replicated DNA could be chased from the matrix by incubating pulse labeled 
      macroplasmodia in media containing unlabeled thymidine. Studies measuring the size 
      distribution of the matrix DNA supported the hypothesis that replication forks are 
      attached to the nuclear matrix. Reconstitution controls indicated that these results 
      were unlikely to be due to preferential, nonspecific binding of nascent DNA to the 
      matrix during the extraction procedures. These results with P. polycephalum in 
      combination with previous studies in non-synchronized rodent cells, suggest that the 
      association of newly replicated DNA with the nuclear matrix may be a general feature 
      of eucaryotic DNA replication.

TI  - Changes in diadenosine tetraphosphate levels in Physarum polycephalum with different 
      oxygen concentrations.
PG  - 1506-12
AB  - Cellular levels of diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap4A) were measured, by a specific 
      high-pressure liquid chromatography method, in microplasmodia of Physarum 
      polycephalum subjected to different degrees of hypoxia, hyperoxia, and treatment 
      with H2O2. Ap4A levels increased three- to sevenfold under anaerobic conditions, and 
      the microplasmodia remained viable after such treatment. Elevated levels of Ap4A 
      returned to the basal level within 5 to 10 min upon reoxygenation of the 
      microplasmodia. The increases in Ap4A levels were larger in stationary-phase or 
      starved microplasmodia than in fed, log-phase microplasmodia. The maximal increase 
      measured in log-phase microplasmodia was twofold. No significant changes in Ap4A 
      levels occurred in microplasmodia subjected to mild hypoxia, hyperoxia, or treatment 
      with 1 mM H2O2. These results indicate that in P. polycephalum, Ap4A may function in 
      the metabolic response to anaerobic conditions rather than in the response to 
      oxidative stress.

AB  - Recent studies with amoebae of the Myxomycetes Didymium iridis and Physarum 
      polycephalum reveal that competence to undergo sexual fusion or to differentiate to 
      plasmodia apogamically can be induced by a diffusible factor. Suspension cultures of 
      Didymium amoebae have proven to be a good source of the inducer activity. Cell-free 
      culture supernatants accelerated mating of Didymium and Physarum amoebae and also 
      apogamic differentiation of the Physarum strain Colonia . Characterization and 
      purification of the inducer activity is being conducted with a semiquantitative 
      bioassay based on the induction of zygote formation in suspensions of 
      mating-compatible Didymium amoebae.

TI  - Effects of cytochalasin A on the morphology of plasmodia and sclerotia of Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 10-22
AB  - Cytochalasin A (CA) at 1.6 X 10(-5)M and lower concentrations produced disruptive 
      effects upon plasmodia, sclerotia, and spherule forms of Physarum polycephalum. CA 
      effects upon either micro- or macroplasmodia included: cytoplasmic condensation, 
      plasmodial contraction, and scission at the plasma membrane. The latter 
      manifestation was most dramatically observed by scanning electron microscopy. 
      Electron microscopy of drug-treated palsmodia confirmed the above phase contrast 
      light-microscopic results and revealed, in addition, vacuolar enlargement, decreased 
      membrane invaginations, and the presence of condensed particles within the 
      plasmodium and at the plasma membrane. These results of drug action were not 
      reversed by washing of exposed plasmodia. Germination of the slcerotial and spherule 
      forms of Physarum was CA-delayed by 12 and 96 hours, respectively. Approximately 10% 
      of drug-treated sclerotia were found to have been burst apart. These dramatic CA 
      effects were nullified by preincubation of the drug either with L-cysteine or with 
      beta-mercaptoethanol; however, iodoacetamide (10(-6)M) gave no such morphologic 
      consequences. Cytochalasins B or D at comparable concentrations were without 
      activity. It is concluded therefore that CA effects upon the myoxomycete reflect 
      specific acceptor responses.

TI  - Gene expression kinetics in individual plasmodial cells reveal alternative programs 
      of differential regulation during commitment and differentiation.
PG  - 408-420
LID - 10.1111/dgd.12220 [doi]
AB  - During its life cycle, the amoebozoon Physarum polycephalum forms multinucleate 
      plasmodial cells that can grow to macroscopic size while maintaining a naturally 
      synchronous population of nuclei. Sporulation-competent plasmodia were stimulated 
      through photoactivation of the phytochrome photoreceptor and the expression of 
      sporulation marker genes was analyzed quantitatively by repeatedly taking samples of 
      the same plasmodial cell at successive time points after the stimulus pulse. 
      Principal component analysis of the gene expression data revealed that plasmodial 
      cells take different trajectories leading to cell fate decision and differentiation 
      and suggested that averaging over individual cells is inappropriate. Queries for 
      genes with pairwise correlated expression kinetics revealed qualitatively different 
      patterns of co-regulation, indicating that alternative programs of differential 
      regulation are operational in individual plasmodial cells. At the single cell level, 
      the response to stimulation of a non-sporulating mutant was qualitatively different 
      as compared to the wild type with respect to the differentially regulated genes and 
      their patterns of co-regulation. The observation of individual differences during 
      commitment and differentiation supports the concept of a Waddington-type 
      quasipotential landscape for the regulatory control of cell differentiation. 
      Comparison of wild type and sporulation mutant data further supports the idea that 
      mutations may impact the topology of this landscape.

TI  - Conversion of positive to negative chemotaxis by Ca2+ ionophore treatment in 
      plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 436-43
AB  - The plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum was treated with Ca2+ ionophores A23187 or 
      X-537A, and the effects on the chemotactic and contractile activities were studied 
      by applying a double-chamber method and an optical method. (1) At low Ca2+ 
      concentration, attractants (glucose, L-alanine) KH2PO4) remained as attractants and 
      induced a relaxation in the plasmodial strand. Increase in the external Ca2+ level 
      caused a contraction of plasmodium with the same stimuli, and hence converted the 
      attractants to repellents. (2) This phenomenon was specific to Ca2+; Mg2+, Sr2+ or 
      Ba2+ showed no appreciable effects. (3) Repellents (sucrose, KCl, Quinine) induced a 
      contraction, which was not altered by the Ca2+ ionophore treatment. (4) Efflux of 
      Ca2+, which was measured by chemiluminescence of aequorin, increased on glucose 
      reception in the presence of ionophore.

TI  - Different chromatin structures in Physarum polycephalum: a special form of 
      transcriptionally active chromatin devoid of nucleosomal particles.
PG  - 279-90
AB  - Nonnucleolar chromatin from interphase nuclei of Physarum polycephalum plasmodia 
      occurs in two different structural configurations as seen in electron microscopic 
      spread preparations. While the majority of the chromatin is devoid of nascent 
      ribonucleoprotein (RNP) fibrils and compacted into nucleosomal particles, a minor 
      proportion (10-20%) is organized differently and reveals a smooth contour. It is 
      this form of smooth chromatin which is rich in transcription units (mean length: 
      1.36 +/- 0.21 micrometer). Only occasionally are solitary nascent RNP fibrils 
      observed which are associated with beaded strands of chromatin. In transcribed 
      smooth chromatin nucleosomal particles are not only absent from the transcription 
      units but also from their nontranscribed flanking regions, indicating that this 
      special structural aspect is not merely a direct consequence of the transcriptional 
      process. The existence of ca. 10-20% of Physarum chromatin in the smoothly contoured 
      form is discussed in relation to reports of a preferential digestibility of a 
      similar proportion of Physarum chromatin by DNAse I (Jalouzot et al., 1980) and to 
      the altered configuration of "peak A" chromatin subunits after micrococcal nuclease 
      digestion (Johnson et al., 1978 a, b).

TI  - Muliple sites of action of cycloheximide in addition to inhibition of protein 
      synthesis in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 109-15
AB  - The specificity action of cycloheximide was tested using a cycloheximide resistant 
      mutant of Physarum polycephalum. This resistance has previously been shown to reside 
      with the ribosomes, making cytoplasmic protein synthesis refractile to the action of 
      the drug. We show here that cycloheximide in the mutant strain causes specific 
      alterations in metabolism without influencing the growth rate. These are: 1. lowered 
      specific activity of glutamate dehydrogenase during starvation, 2. alteration of the 
      molecular weight of glutamate dehydrogenase, 3. inhibition of uptake of amino acids 
      from the medium into the internal pools. Possible explanations for these effects of 
      cycloheximide outside of protein synthesis per se are considered. We conclude that 
      cycloheximide may not be considered a specific inhibitor of protein synthesis, and 
      that a causal relationship between protein synthesis and any biological process 
      cannot be claimed unless such specificity is demonstrated in each case, preferably 
      by use of mutants.

      polycephalum.
PG  - 361-9
AB  - 1. About 15% of nucleolar DNA (1.712 g/cm3) from Physarum polycephalum displaying 
      maximum hybridization to ribosomal RNA, is composed of circular DNA of 3.9 +/- 0.2 
      mum contour length or multiples thereof. 2. A portion of these circular molecules 
      (25%) contained linear DNA pieces longer than circumference length. In a small 
      fraction of circular DNA linear pieces, shorter than the unit length, were observed. 
      3. Most nucleolar DNA, [3H]thymidine-labeled or hybridizable to ribosomal RNA was 
      separable from chromosomal DNA during G2 phase, mitosis and S phase of the cell 
      cycle. 4. Ribosomal DNA content was not amplified during the cell cycle, was 
      unchanged during exponential or stationary growth phase and amounted to about 0.11 
      -- 0.21% of nuclear DNA in diploid and hexaploid strains of Physarum or 100--200 
      ribosomal genes per diploid genome.

TI  - The use of netropsin with CsCl gradients for the analysis of DNA and its application 
      to restriction nuclease fragments of ribosomal DNA from Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 569-76
AB  - Netropsin binds to DNA in caesium chloride density gradients and reduces the density 
      of the DNA. The DNA is saturated at a netropsin/DNA weight ratio of about 6 and the 
      change in density, deltarho, at saturation is given by deltarho = -109 (dA + dT 
      content)1.87 mg/ml for the six DNAs tested covering dA + dT contents from 0.28 to 
      0.69. At lower netropsin/DNA ratios the observed density shifts are consistent with 
      a two-site model for netropsin binding to DNA. Netropsin approximately doubles the 
      resolution of Physarum polycephalum nucleolar satellite DNA from main-band DNA. The 
      fragments of P. polycephalum nucleolar satellite DNA obtained with the restriction 
      endonuclease HindIII do not separate on CsCl gradients, even in the presence of 
      netropsin, which shows that the transcribed and non-transcribed sequences in this 
      DNA have similar nucleotide compositions.

TI  - Negative control of periodic tubulin gene expression in the mitotic cycle of 
      Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 179-81
AB  - Naturally synchronous syncytial plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum provide an ideal 
      model for studying the eukaryotic cell cycle. The tubulin genes of Physarum provide 
      a striking example of cell cycle-regulated gene expression: synthesis of both 
      tubulin mRNA and the tubulin proteins is limited to the last three hours of G2 
      phase. Fusion of late G2-phase plasmodia, in which the tubulin genes are actively 
      expressed, and mid-S phase plasmodia, in which the tubulin genes are not expressed, 
      is used to demonstrate the presence of a diffusible negative regulator of tubulin 
      gene expression in S-phase plasmodia. It is inferred that this factor is responsible 
      for the turning-off of tubulin gene transcription that follows mitosis.

TI  - Changes in phosphorylation of an F-actin capping protein of Physarum polycephalum 
      during the cell cycle.
PG  - 57-62
AB  - The Cap 42(b), a Ca2+-dependent F-actin capping phosphoprotein of 42,000 daltons, 
      was shown to be localized in the cytosol of Physarum polycephalum by measurements of 
      phosphorylatability in the absence of Ca2+. The phosphorylation of Cap 42(b) in the 
      cytosol changed during the cell cycle: it was high in the S and G2 phase, and low in 
      the M phase and boundary phase between S and G2 phase. When the isolated Cap 42(b) 
      was added to M phase cytosol, the phosphorylation of Cap 42(b) was significantly 
      increased by at least 6-fold. Compared with this result, about 2-fold increase in 
      the phosphorylation of Cap 42(b) was observed when the Cap 42(b) kinase was added to 
      M phase cytosol. Therefore, it is likely that the low level of Cap 42(b) 
      phosphorylation in M phase cytosol is mostly due to the decreased amount of 
      phosphorylatable Cap 42(b) and to a lesser extent due to a low level of the Cap 
      42(b) kinase activity.

TI  - Reactivation of NBD-phallacidin-labelled actomyosin fibrils in cryosections of 
      Physarum polycephalum: a new cell-free model.
PG  - 1065-8
AB  - Application of ATP to cryosections of plasmodial strands from Physarum polycephalum 
      leads to an isotonic contraction of the cytoplasmic actomyosin fibrils: when the 
      fibrils are labelled with NBD-phallacidin, their contraction can be observed in the 
      fluorescence microscope. While performing contraction, the fibrils separate into 
      many small units and the formerly continuous fibrils exhibit the appearance of 
      beaded chains. The possibility of visualizing directly the contraction of 
      cytoplasmic actomyosin fibrils in the fluorescence microscope represents a 
      favourable condition for the study of their physiological contraction mechanism, 
      because this new and convenient cell-free model offers in situ contractile 
      structures that are non-denatured and non-extracted.

TI  - The structure of nucleolar chromatin in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 667-78
AB  - The nucleolar DNA of Physarum polycephalum has been differentially labelled with 
      3H-thymidine and the structure of the nucleolar chromatin investigated by digestion 
      with micrococcal nuclease. Nucleolar chromatin which had been labelled in G2 phase 
      of the cell cycle and then digested before mitosis had an identical DNA repeat 
      length to main band DNA (165 +/- 5 base pairs) but there was a definite indication 
      that the rate of digestion was faster for nucleolar DNA than for main band DNA. 
      Nucleolar chromatin which had been labelled in G2 and the label chased through 
      mitosis into G2 phase of the next cycle showed an identical DNA repeat length to 
      main band DNA and was also digested at the same rate. We conclude that nucleolar 
      chromatin, at least 25 per cent of which is maximally transcriptionally active in 
      G2, has a nucleosome-like structure.

AB  - Eight exo-glycosidase activities were detected in the axenic culture medium of the 
      myxomycete, Physarum polycephalum. The secretion of each enzyme examined followed 
      the growth curve and continued during the stationary phase after the cessation of 
      growth. Two or more forms of each enzyme were detected after electrophoretic 
      separation. The beta-N-acetyl-D-hexosaminidase activity was readily separated into 
      its two electrophoretic forms, X and Y, which were purified 145- and 306-fold 
      respectively. These beta-N-acetyl-D-hexosaminidases had several similar 
      characteristics. Evidence is presented that the major electrophoretic form of 
      alpha-D-galactosidase is heterogeneous. The possible functions of extracellular

TI  - In situ preparation of the nuclear matrix of Physarum polycephalum: ultrastructural 
      and biochemical analysis of different matrix isolation procedures.
PG  - 621-8
AB  - A novel method for in situ preparation of nuclear matrix from whole plasmodia of 
      Physarum polycephalum without isolation of nuclei is presented. Plasmodia are 
      encapsulated in agarose beads and after solubilization of the cytoplasm the nuclear 
      matrix is prepared. With this quick and easy technique nuclear matrix can be 
      reproducibly prepared with perfect recovery. We compared the ultrastructural and 
      biochemical properties of the matrix after three different matrix isolation 
      procedures: preparation with high salt, ammonium sulphate and lithium 
      diiodosalicylic acid. The results show that the ultrastructure and protein 
      composition of the three types of matrix are very similar or even identical. We 
      conclude that many of the conflicting results on nuclear matrix in the literature 
      are due to perturbations of nuclear integrity during the isolation of nuclei. For 
      this reason the new in situ method is an important approach in the standardization 
      of nuclear matrix isolation.

PG  - 1595-605
AB  - Isoelectric focusing of plasmodial extracts of Physarum polycephalum demonstrated 
      the presence of several multiple enzyme variants of thymidine kinase, which appear 
      sequentially during the nuclear division cycle. Variants (A) + (A1) are the only 
      enzyme variants found in the late G2-phase, whereas the variants (C) + (C1) are only 
      present at the time of mitosis and S-phase (1, 2). Evidence is presented that 
      multiple forms of thymidine kinase (A) + (A1) with high pI arise by 
      dephosphorylation of a primary translation product with low pI (C and/or C1). The 
      thymidine kinase fractions (A) + (A1) and (C) + (C1) + (c1) were separated and 
      partially purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. The enzyme variants (C) + (C1) 
      are converted in vitro by an endogenous enzymatic factor as well as by bacterial 
      alkaline phosphatase into the variants (A) + (A1).

PG  - 357-64
AB  - Ribosomes from Physarum polycephalum were purified. Optimal conditions for 
      preparation and stability of subunits were determined. KCl concentration above 200 
      mM induced protein dissociation from the subunits. It was observed that dissociated 
      ribosomes were more stable in a low ionic strength buffer than in 200 mM KCl, where 
      the 40 S was preferentially degraded by ribonucleases. Ribosomal proteins were 
      analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The first dimension was carried out 
      at pH 8.6 while the second was run at pH 4.6. The monosome contained sixty seven 
      proteins, of which six were acidic. Two proteins were lost after subunit 
      dissociation. Twenty six basic and two acidic proteins were observed in the 40 S 
      subunit while the largest subunit gave thirty nine spots on the basic part of the 
      gel and three additional spots on the acidic side. Five proteins were shared by 40 S 
      and 60 S.

TI  - Sequence organisation in nuclear DNA from Physarum polycephalum. Genomic 
      organisation of DNA segments containing foldback sequences.
PG  - 204-13
AB  - DNA clones containing foldback sequences, derived from Physarum polycephalum nuclear 
      DNA, can be classified according to their pattern of hybridisation to Southern blots 
      of genomic DNA. One group of DNA clones map to unique DNA loci when used as a probe 
      to restriction digests of Physarum nuclear DNA. These cloned segments appear to 
      contain dispersed repetitive sequence elements located at many hundreds of sites in 
      the genome. Similar patterns of hybridisation are generated when these cloned DNA 
      probes are annealed to DNA restriction fragments of genomic DNA obtained from a 
      number of different Physarum strains, indicating that no detectable alteration has 
      occurred at these genomic loci subsequent to the divergence of the strains as a 
      result of the introduction or deletion of mobile genetic elements. However, deletion 
      of segments of some cloned DNA fragments occurs following their propagation in 
      Escherichia coli. A second, distinct group of clones are shown to be derived from 
      highly methylated segments of Physarum DNA which contain very abundant repetitive 
      sequences with regular, though complex, arrangements of restriction sites at their 
      various genomic locations. It is suggested that these DNA segments contain clustered 
      repetitive sequence elements. The results lead to the conclusion that foldback 
      elements in Physarum DNA are located in segments of the genome which display 
      markedly different patterns of sequence organisation and degree of DNA methylation.

TI  - Topoisomerase I in actively growing plasmodia and during differentiation of the 
      slime mold Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 36-40
AB  - A type I topoisomerase has been purified from nuclei of a slime mold Physarum 
      polycephalum and its activity was tested during spherulation. The final preparation 
      contained a single polypeptide of about 100 kDa. Basic properties of Physarum 
      topoisomerase I (substrate specificity, ionic requirement, sensitivity to 
      inhibitors) were similar to those of topoisomerases from higher eukaryotes. Specific 
      features of Physarum enzyme were that it was rapidly inactivated at 45 degrees C and 
      did not react with antibodies against human topoisomerase I. The activity of 
      topoisomerase I in developed dormant spherules decreased approx. 2-fold, as compared 
      with a 4-fold decrease of RNA and a 10-fold decrease of DNA synthesis. Basic 
      properties of the enzyme remained unchanged during spherulation.

PG  - 575-80
AB  - Light treatment of nuclei of Physarum polycephalum microplasmodia with DNase I, at 
      low MgCl2 concentration (less than or equal to 3% DNA acid solubility, 0.1 mM MgCl2) 
      selectively solubilizes a defined fraction of chromatin, in the form of a 
      macromolecular complex. This fraction (up to 15% of the total chromatin) contains a 
      full complement of the core histones and a reduced amount of histone H1, and is 
      enriched in the high-mobility-group type of proteins. It is preferentially 
      associated with nascent RNA and RNA polymerase B actively engaged in transcription. 
      Digestion of DNAase-I-solubilized chromatin by micrococcal nuclease releases a 
      size-heterogeneous population of cleavage products, indicative of lack of a typical 
      nucleosomal packaging. It is concluded that the procedure used allows the isolation 
      of structurally and functionally distinct regions of Physarum chromatin.

TI  - Changes in protein and RNA during asexual differentiation of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 438-47
AB  - Some of the events during the growth and asexual differentiation of Physarum 
      polycephalum amoebae are described. Encysted amoebae contain low levels of protein 
      and RNA. When these cells are mixed with bacteria and inoculated onto agar plates, 
      there is an increase in cellular RNA content followed by an increase in protein 
      content. The cellular RNA and protein contents of all strains tested decrease during 
      the subsequent cell divisions. In nondifferentiating cells (strain Cl at 30 degrees 
      C and strain LU648), RNA and protein contents continue to decrease, and the cell 
      eventually encyst. In the asexually differentiating strain Cl grown at 26 degrees C, 
      the cellular RNA and protein contents stop decreasing and begin to increase when the 
      first amoebae become committed to form plasmodia. At early stages of differentiation 
      a new 36,000 molecular weight polypeptide appears. In fully formed plasmodia another 
      polypeptide of 38,000 molecular is observed. These two plasmodial-specific 
      polypeptides are among the most abundant plasmodial proteins.

TI  - The isolation of coupled mitochondria from Physarum polycephalum and their response 
      to Ca2+.
PG  - 94-105
AB  - A method for the isolation of coupled mitochondria from the acellular slime mould 
      Physarum polycephalum is described. The mitochondria oxidize respiratory substrates 
      at rates comparable to those of mitochondria from other microorganisms and show 
      similar responses to respiratory inhibitors. ADP/O values approach similar values to 
      those obtained with mitochondria from higher organisms: 3 with NAD-linked 
      substrates, 2 with succinate, and 1 with ascorbate-TMPD. Mitochondria actively take 
      up low concentrations of Ca2+ with stimulation of their respiration. With succinate 
      or pyruvate-malate as substrates respiratory responses are depressed by Ca2+ 
      concentrations in excess of 200 micron in the presence or absence of phosphate. 
      Exogenous NADH is unique in supporting the uptake of large amounts of Ca2+ in the 
      presence of phosphate and in showing an unusual 'uncoupled' response in the absence 
      of phosphate. A sigmoidal relationship occurs between initial velocity of Ca2+ 
      uptake and Ca2+ concentration with a maximum velocity of approx. 15 nmol/s per mg 
      protein and half maximum velocity occurring at approx. 50 micron Ca2+.

PG  - 1013-21
AB  - Isoacceptors of Physarum polycephalum Ala-, Arg-, Glu-, Gln-, Gly-, Ile-, Leu-, 
      Lys-, Ser-, Thr-, and Val-tRNAs were resolved by reverse-phase chromatography and 
      isolated, and their codon recognition properties were determined in a ribosomal 
      binding assay. Codon assignments were made to most isoacceptors, and they are 
      summarized along with those determined in other studies from Escherichia coli, 
      yeasts, wheat germ, hymenoptera, Xenopus, and mammals. The patterns of codon 
      recognition by isoacceptors from P. polycephalum are more similar to those of 
      animals than to those of plants or lower fungi.

TI  - The F-actin capping proteins of Physarum polycephalum: cap42(a) is very similar, if 
      not identical, to fragmin and is structurally and functionally very homologous to 
      gelsolin; cap42(b) is Physarum actin.
PG  - 4149-57
AB  - We have carried out a primary structure analysis of the F-actin capping proteins of 
      Physarum polycephalum. Cap42(b) was completely sequenced and was found to be 
      identical with Physarum actin. Approximately 88% of the sequence of cap42(a) was 
      determined. Cap42(a) and fragmin were found to be identical by amino acid 
      composition, isoelectric point, mol. wt, elution time on reversed-phase 
      chromatography and amino acid sequence of their tryptic peptides. The available 
      sequence of cap42(a) is greater than 36% homologous with the NH2-terminal 42-kd 
      domain of human gelsolin. A highly homologous region of 16 amino acids is also 
      shared between cap42(a), gelsolin and the Acanthamoeba profilins. Cap42(a) binds two 
      actin molecules in a similar way to gelsolin suggesting a mechanism of F-actin 
      modulation that has been conserved during evolution.

TI  - Identification of ubiquitinated histones 2A and 2B in Physarum polycephalum. 
      Disappearance of these proteins at metaphase and reappearance at anaphase.
PG  - 5147-53
AB  - Ubiquitinated histones uH2A.1, uH2A.Z, and uH2B have been identified in the basic 
      nuclear proteins of the slime mold Physarum polycephalum by three methods: peptide 
      mapping, cross-reaction with anti-ubiquitin antibody, and uH2A and uH2B isopeptidase 
      cleavage. In microplasmodia, uH2A amounts to 7% of H2A and uH2B amounts to 6% of 
      H2B. Detailed studies of mitosis in Physarum polycephalum macroplasmodia show that 
      in early prophase, which last 15 min, the uH2As and uH2B are both strongly present, 
      whereas minutes later in metaphase, which lasts 7 min, they disappear. When the 
      nuclei enter anaphase, which lasts 3 min, both the uH2As and uH2B reappear. These 
      precise studies suggest that cleavage of ubiquitin from the uH2As and uH2B is a very 
      late, possibly final event in chromosome condensation to metaphase chromosomes and 
      that ubiquitination is an early event in their decondensation. It is proposed that 
      the uH2A and uH2B mark specific regions of the genome which have to be 
      deubiquitinated prior to packaging into metaphase chromosomes; after metaphase these 
      regions are the first to be decondensed and ubiquitinated. This modification, 
      however, is not thought to be a general factor in chromosome condensation but labels 
      a specific subcomponent of chromatin containing the expressed genes of a particular 
      cell type or an important subset of these genes required by the cell to be available 
      for activation, e.g. stress genes.

AB  - The acellular slime mold Physarum polycephalum releases a soluble adenosine 3', 
      5'-monophosphate phosphodiesterase into the growth medium. Although this enzyme 
      resembles the particulate diesterase of the same organism in kinetic properties and 
      in inhibition by methyl purines, its greater stability, its insensitivity to 
      stimulation by imidazole and to inhibition by adenosine triphosphate,- and its 
      selective release into the medium indicate a specific function, perhaps protection 
      against exogenous cyclic nucleotide, for the soluble enzyme.

TI  - A purified cellular extract accelerates the cell cycle in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 332-6
AB  - Plasmodia of the myxomycete Physarum polycephalum (strain Cl) were collected at 
      different times during the cell cycle and extracts were prepared from homogenates 
      using a buffer optimized for microinjection into plasmodial veins. These extracts 
      were injected into plasmodia during the first 3 h of the cell cycle. The time of the 
      following mitosis was monitored and compared with that of the buffer-injected 
      controls. Extracts of plasmodia homogenized 45 min before late telophase accelerated 
      the onset of mitosis in the injected plasmodium up to 70 min, i.e., an advance of 
      10-14% compared to the 8- to 10-h cell cycle duration of the controls. The 
      accelerating activity vanished completely after heating, freezing, or protease 
      digestion, thus indicating the peptide nature of the active agent. Purification of 
      the active compound by means of gel filtration revealed a molecular mass of about 
      2500 Da. The active portion of the extract was further fractionated by HPLC and the 
      activity determined in a single peak.

AB  - The effects of two inhibitors of 3-hydroxy 3-methyl glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase 
      (tunicamycin and mevinolin) on nuclear division in the myxomycete Physarum 
      polycephalum were examined. Tunicamycin exerted a minor effect on division in 
      synchronized cultures, whereas mevinolin delayed the second, third and fourth 
      nuclear divisions with increasing efficiency. Mevinolin also appeared to be the more 
      potent inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, which catalyses the rate-limiting step in the 
      biosynthesis of cholesterol and other isoprene derivatives. These effects of 
      mevinolin could be partially reversed by the addition of mevalonate, suggesting that 
      mevinolin exerts its inhibitory effects on Physarum nuclear division by decreasing 
      the activity of HMG-CoA reductase.

TI  - Calcium binding sites in plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum as revealed by the 
      pyroantimonate technique.
PG  - 1177-84
AB  - Plasmodia of the acellular slime mold, Physarum polycephalum, were treated with an 
      osmium tetroxide fixative containing potassium pyroantimonate to precipitate calcium 
      and thereby localize calcium binding sites and sites of increased calcium 
      concentration. Dense calcium pyroantimonate precipitates were detected within the 
      nucleoli. The distribution of these precipitates during interphase and mitosis 
      coincides with the distribution of the unique minichromosomes in Physarum, i.e., the 
      numerous short pieces of extrachromosomal nucleolar chromatin containing segments of 
      amplified DNA coding for ribosomal RNA. Calcium pyroantimonate precipitates were 
      present as frequent dense granules in the mitochondrial matrix and as fine 
      precipitates in the mitochondrial nucleoid. Large calcium-containing precipitates 
      were seen within cytoplasmic vacuoles, confirming reports by others. In addition, we 
      have identified calcium binding sites along the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma 
      membrane. The distribution of calcium within the plasmodium is discussed in relation 
      to the assembly of the mitotic spindle and the regulation of cell motility.

      molecular weights of 204000 and 116000 respectively. Both forms eluted together from

      sedimentation coefficients were 7.6 and 5.2 S. The frictional ratios of 1.69 suggest 
      a highly hydrated and/or an asymmetric structure of the molecule. The 
      enzyme-catalyzed reaction was sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide (60% inhibition by 1 
      mM). Unlike DNA polymerase alpha from mammalian cells the Physarum enzyme was 
      stimulated by 30 mM NaCl. Activated DNA was the preferred template. Poly(A) . (DT)12 
      was not accepted. The Km value for deoxynucleoside triphosphates was 3 micron, for 
      activated DNA 50 microgram/ml and for Mg2+ at the optimum [k+] of 150 mM about 0.6 
      mM.

TI  - Variance of ploidy in mitochondrial nucleus during spherulation in Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 359-73
AB  - In Physarum polycephalum, microplasmodia differentiated into spherules when cultures 
      were aged for 8-10 days. Respiration rates of the microplasmodia decreased rapidly 
      with ageing to a 90% decrease in oxygen consumption over 9 days. We studied this 
      phenomena by isolating and characterizing mitochondria from microplasmodia and 
      spherules at different stages of spherulation. Oxygen uptake by the isolated 
      mitochondria decreased with spherulation. Morphological and biochemical analyses 
      showed that mitochondrial differentiation to inactive state was characterized by a 
      decrease not only in dimension but also of content (DNA, RNA and protein). 
      Diminutive mitochondria contained small particle-shaped mitochondrial nuclei. The 
      DNA content, measured by microscopic fluorometry, was about 1.15 and 0.58 X 10(-10) 
      g, which corresponded to about 16 and 8 genome copies, respectively (e.g., 32 genome 
      copies per mitochondrion at mitochondrial G1). Restriction endonuclease analysis 
      showed that the physical structure and methylation pattern of the mtDNA had not 
      changed although the DNA content per mitochondrion had decreased remarkably with 
      spherulation. This showed that changes in the ploidy level of the mitochondrial 
      nucleus during spherulation were due to reduction in the number of whole 
      mitochondrial genomes.

TI  - Induction of heat-shock proteins at permissive growth temperatures in the plasmodium 
      of the myxomycete Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 49-56
AB  - When synchronous plasmodia of the myxomycete Physarum polycephalum were submitted to 
      temperature shifts from 22 degrees C to 32 degrees C, the highest physiological 
      temperature, protein synthesis was increased during at least 10 h. Moreover during 2 
      h, four proteins (69, 74, 82 and 105 kDa) showed a transient increase of their 
      synthesis, independently of the period of the temperature shift during the cell 
      cycle. The stability of these proteins and the susceptibility of their synthesis to 
      actinomycin suggested that they corresponded to four different proteins. Temperature 
      shifts from 22 degrees C or 29 degrees C to 37 degrees C, a non-physiological 
      temperature, demonstrated that the 69-kDa, 74-kDa, 82-kDa and 105-kDa proteins were 
      identical to the four heat-shock proteins which could be detected in Physarum. 
      Although the physiological significance of these heat-shock proteins remained 
      unclear, comparison between the extent of their synthesis and the length of the 
      mitotic delays induced by various temperature shifts ruled out a direct relationship 
      between mitotic delays and synthesis of the 74-kDa, 82-kDa and 105-kDa proteins.

TI  - Blue light influences gene expression and motility in starving microplasmodia of 
      Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 12-26
AB  - The differentiation of starving Physarum polycephalum microplasmodia into resting 
      structures (spherules) was studied. Early events in this differentiation pathway 
      include decreases in both plasmodial motility and protein synthesis. The starving 
      plasmodia show a blue light avoidance response. Blue light (lambda max 450 nm, 
      irradiance 16 W/m2) acts antagonistically to the starvation stimulus so that 
      spherule formation is inhibited [16]. Light affects each of the above mentioned 
      events of the differentiation pathway: the migration rate of illuminated plasmodia 
      is stimulated, the light avoidance response is irreversibly lost. The rate of 
      incorporation of radioactive leucine into plasmodial protein remains at a higher 
      level in illuminated plasmodia as compared to the decreasing rate during spherule 
      formation in the dark. Protein degradation, uptake of external leucine, and the size 
      of the internal leucine pool are not affected by light. Analysis by 
      SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of pulse-labelled plasmodial proteins reveals 
      that blue light inhibits the synthesis of distinct starvation-induced proteins and 
      allows continued synthesis of all major plasmodial proteins. Some of the blue light 
      responses described are mimicked by alpha-amanitin suggesting that light might 
      influence gene expression at the level of transcription.

      phase and decreased to a minimal value in late G2 phase or M phase, while total 
      actin content in a nucleus, which was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel 
      electrophoresis as well as by DNase inhibition assay in the presence of 0.75 M 
      guanidine-HCl, did not show such phase-dependent dynamics through the cell cycle.

PG  - 589-95
AB  - The effects of naturally occurring metabolites were tested on the malate 
      dehydrogenase (L-malate: NAD+oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.37) isozymes from the 
      eucaryotic protist Physarum polycephalum. Several of the Krebs cycle intermediates 
      were inhibitors for each isozyme indicating that a similar catalytic process was 
      involved for both forms. The metabolites ATP, ADP, and AMP were inhibitors 
      competitive with NAD for the mitochondrial isozyme but not the supernatant form. 
      Several other nucleoside phosphates had no effects. Tests of protein sulfhydryl, 
      arginine- and tyrosine-modifying reagents revealed a similar functional sensitivity 
      by both isozymes to these reagents. Those results are compared with data on isozymes 
      from more complex tissue with comments on the physiological significance of those 
      combined data.

LID - 10.1007/BF02531230 [doi]
AB  - Rapidly growing plasmodia of the acellular slime mold,Physarum polycephalum, contain 
      large amounts of ether-linked lipids. The ether bonds occur principally in the 
      phospholipids, where plasmalogens account for 21-24 mole per cent of the total and 
      alkyl ether phospholipids comprise 12 mole per cent of the total. Plasmalogens 
      account for over half of the ethanolamine phosphatides, while the alkyl ether 
      derivatives are more uniformly distributed among the various phospholipid fractions. 
      The 16 carbon side chain is by far the major component of both the saturated and the 
      α,β-unsaturated ether derivatives. The nature and amounts of ether lipids present 
      inPhysarum add to the growing evidence that Myxomycetes are more closely related to 
      protozoa than to fungi.

TI  - Laser microscope irradiation of Physarum polycephalum: dynamic and ultrastructural 
      effects.
PG  - 108-19
AB  - Streaming plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum were irradiated with a 
      microscope-mounted ruby laser and the resulting changes were recorded by 
      cinemicrography or streak photographs. Some lesions were processed for electron 
      microscopy. By varying the incident energy, three levels of response were detected. 
      Two transient responses, a gelation briefly blocking streams and a more severe 
      gelation with contraction, changed movement patterns but not organelle 
      ultrastructure. At higher energies, a permanently coagulated lesion was rapidly 
      segregated from normal and transiently altered cytoplasm by formation of new 
      membranes. Within the coagulum, pigment granules were destroyed, membranes were 
      disrupted, and cytoplasm was flocculent. Nuclei and mitochondria were compact in the 
      center and swollen in a peripheral space left by contraction of the coagulum. These 
      changes are probably caused by heat produced by the interaction between the laser 
      beam and the pigment granules of the plasmodium. Many of the changes seem to be 
      secondary responses that follow the primary capture of energy during irradiation.

TI  - Histone H4 gene is transcribed in S phase but also late in G(2) phase in Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 2659-62
AB  - The myxomycete Physarum polycephalum contains two types of H4 histone genes. 
      Southern blotting of restriction endonuclease fragments of P. polycephalum DNA and 
      hybridization to a cloned probe labelled by nick-translation indicate that there are 
      only one or two copies of each H4 gene per haploid genome. A cloned homologous 
      genomic probe was used to study the cellular abundance of H4 mRNA during the cell 
      cycle. We report that the H4 mRNA is not only transcribed in S phase as previously 
      described for other organisms but that transcription of the H4 gene also occurs at 
      the end of G(2) phase. Since no translation of the histone messenger was observed in 
      G(2) phase this suggests that the histone mRNA synthesized in G(2) constitutes a 
      pool of molecules in anticipation of the next S phase.

AB  - Combinations of 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) and 3H-deoxyadenosine (3H-DAdo) short 
      pulses were given in the synchronous DNA-replication period of Physarum 
      polycephalum. After a chase period, UV-photolysis products were analyzed on alkaline 
      sucrose gradients. This strategy has allowed the following conclusions. a) at the 
      time of master-initiation of DNA replication, points separated by 1.1-2.2x10(7) 
      daltons of single strand DNA may initiate DNA synthesis. b) among these, only 
      selected groups of replicons actually proceed in DNA replication at this time, while 
      others appear to hold (later temporal sets of replicons). The origins of the ones 
      that proceed in replication are separated from each other by a distance 
      corresponding to 1.1-2.x10(7) daltons. c) regions in actual replication are 
      separated from each other by increasing distances (up to 1.5x10(8) daltons single 
      strand DNA) at later times in S.

TI  - A calcium-sensitive preparation from Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 4273-8
AB  - Differential ultracentrifugation of an extract of the plasmodium of Physarum 
      polycephalum yields a high-speed fraction which exhibits calcium-sensitive adenosine 
      triphosphate activity at low ionic strength. The rate of inorganic phosphate 
      production increased from 2- to 25-fold in different preparations when the calcium 
      concentration was increased from about 10(-8) to 10(-5) M. Complement fixation using 
      specific antibody to Physarum myosin showed the fraction to contain 3% myosin. By 
      electron microscopy, actin-like microfilaments 50--150 nm long were present. 
      Addition of pure rabbit F-actin or myosin to this fraction activated the ATPase 
      measured in EGTA and so partially reversed the calcium sensitivity. If muscle myosin 
      was added to the supernatant from which the fraction was centrifuged, a "hybrid 
      complex" was obtained which included actin and additional protein from the 
      plasmodium, and this hybrid was also calcium sensitive. Over 85% of the 
      calcium-sensitive, magnesium-activated ATPase could be precipitated by sequential 
      "hybrid" formation. The calcium sensitivity of the hybrid was maximal when formed at 
      the lowest ratios of added myosin to Physarum proteins. It is concluded that the 
      results do not allow a simple interpretation along the lines of either actin-linked 
      or myosin-linked sensitivity. Evidence consistent with both a form of actin-linked 
      and myosin-linked sensitivity is present in our results.

TI  - Transposon-like properties of the major, long repetitive sequence family in the 
      genome of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 3557-62
AB  - A family of long, highly-repetitive sequences, referred to previously as 
      ;HpaII-repeats', dominates the genome of the eukaryotic slime mould Physarum 
      polycephalum. These sequences are found exclusively in scrambled clusters. They 
      account for about one-half of the total complement of repetitive DNA in Physarum, 
      and represent the major sequence component found in hypermethylated, 20-50 kb 
      segments of Physarum genomic DNA that fail to be cleaved using the restriction 
      endonuclease HpaII. The structure of this abundant repetitive element was 
      investigated by analysing cloned segments derived from the hypermethylated genomic 
      DNA compartment. We show that the ;HpaII-repeat' forms part of a larger repetitive 
      DNA structure, approximately 8.6 kb in length, with several structural features in 
      common with recognised eukaryotic transposable genetic elements. Scrambled clusters 
      of the sequence probably arise as a result of transposition-like events, during 
      which the element preferentially recombines in either orientation with target sites 
      located in other copies of the same repeated sequence. The target sites for 
      transposition/recombination are not related in sequence but in all cases studied 
      they are potentially capable of promoting the formation of small ;cruciforms' or 
      ;Z-DNA' structures which might be recognised during the recombination process.

TI  - Patterns of histone acetylation in the cell cycle of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 1489-96
AB  - Labeling of histones in the naturally synchronous cell cycle of Physarum 
      polycephalum with short pulses of tritiated acetate in vivo clearly showed three 
      distinct patterns of histone acetate turnover. In G2 phase, turnover of acetate was 
      observed only in histones H3 and H4, predominantly on the multiple acetylated forms. 
      No acetate turnover was found in histones H2A and H2B compared with histones H3 and 
      H4. In S phase, intense labeling was seen in all four core histones, in histones H3 
      and H4 predominantly in the low acetylated forms. In addition, cotranslational 
      acetylation of the amino-terminal serines of histones H4 and H1 was observed during 
      S phase. During mitosis, from condensation at prophase to decondensation after 
      telophase, acetate turnover is almost zero. This suggests that within the 
      mitotically condensed chromosomes all potential histone acetylation sites are 
      masked. In G2 phase, when transcription is occurring, only histones H3 and H4 are 
      available for acetate turnover, but in S phase, when both transcription and 
      replication occur, all four histones are available for acetate turnover.

AB  - Changes in phospholipid composition and phospholipase D activity were observed 
      during a differentiation from haploid myxoamoebae to diploid plasmodia of a true 
      slime mold, Physarum polycephalum. In the amoeboid stage, the main components of 
      phospholipid fraction were phosphatidylethanolamine (PE, 43.3%), phosphatidylcholine 
      (PC, 28.8%) and phosphatidylinositol (PI, 8.0%), but in the plasmodial stage, PC was 
      dominant (40.7%) and other main components were PE (31.5%) and phosphatidic acid 
      (PA, 11.0%). The specific activity of phospholipase D in the plasmodia was 5.7-times 
      higher than that in the myxoamoebae when measured in the presence of Ca2+ at the 
      alkaline pH. In the amoeboid stage, phospholipase A activity (A1 or A2) was detected 
      at the alkaline pH with Ca2+. Phospholipase D activity in the plasmodia was 
      characterized: pH optimum was 6.0; Ca2+ was required for the reaction and Ba2+ could 
      substitute partly for Ca2+; PE was the best substrate for the hydrolytic activity 
      and PC and PI were not appreciably hydrolyzed; and all detergents tested inhibited 
      the enzyme activity.

TI  - Cloning and expression of a beta tubulin gene of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 491-5
AB  - A beta tubulin gene of Physarum polycephalum has been isolated from a genomic 
      library in the phage EMBL4. Southern-blot hybridization to genomic DNA indicates 
      that the cloned DNA is derived from the betB1 locus of the beta tubulin gene family. 
      A tubulin-specific subfragment of the phage DNA was used as a hybridization probe to 
      construct a restriction map of the betB1 locus. The probe consisted of the almost 
      complete coding region of the 5' half of the tubulin gene, interrupted by one 
      intron. The derived amino acid sequence of this subclone deviates from the protein 
      sequence for Physarum amoebal beta tubulin (amino acids 4-207) in two of 207 amino 
      acids. We used both recA and recBC sbcB bacterial host strains, which have been 
      recommended for cloning of instability-conferring sequences of the Physarum genome, 
      but were unable to subclone the 3' part of the gene from the phage DNA. 
      Primer-extension analysis indicates that the betB gene is expressed in the 
      vegetatively proliferating amoebal and plasmodial stages of the life cycle as well 
      as in differentiating (sporulating) plasmodia.

TI  - Cell-cycle-dependent effects of sodium-n-butyrate in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 303-11
AB  - Sodium-n-butyrate affects the length of the mitotic cycle of Physarum polycephalum. 
      Application during S- or early G2-period results in a delay of the subsequent 
      mitosis, whereas application later in the cycle has no delaying effect. 
      Interestingly, the second mitotic cycle after application is considerably shortened 
      when butyrate has been administered during S- or early G2-period of the preceding 
      cycle. In comparison, other homologous short-chain fatty acids were tested; the 
      retarding effect on mitosis increases with the number of carbon atoms, although only 
      butyrate can shorten the second mitotic cycle. It is shown that butyrate causes an 
      immediate depression of synthesis of DNA, RNA and protein. After a certain 
      time-interval the plasmodium overcomes the butyrate block. DNA synthesis is fully 
      recovered and the inhibition of RNA and protein synthesis is even overcompensated 
      until the next mitosis, as reflected by elevated levels of RNA and protein.

TI  - Structural homogeneity of mitochondrial DNA in the mitochondrial nucleoid of 
      Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 290-8
AB  - Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of Physarum polycephalum was isolated gently by CsCl 
      centrifugation. The mtDNA was linear with molecular weights ranging from 25 . 10(6) 
      to 45 . 10(6) and heterogeneous in size. Nevertheless, thermal transition profiles 
      of the mtDNA suggested that this DNA fraction was more homogeneous than nuclear DNA. 
      Exhaustive digestions of this DNA with restriction endonucleases yielded unique 
      fragments, and then the total of their molecular weights of each digest was around 
      45 . 10(6). This value is equivalent to the maximum molecular weight estimated using 
      electron microscopy and electrophoresis. Moreover, EcoRI digests of the mtDNA 
      fractionated by the sucrose gradient showed unequimolar quantities of large 
      fragments and a high background between bands. These results suggest that the mtDNA 
      of Physarum has a homogeneous base sequence, and that the size heterogeneity of the 
      mtDNA is attributable to degradation of the DNA under isolation procedures. The 
      mtDNA was cleaved by EcoRI and XhoI to yield 16 and 7 fragments, respectively. A 
      physical map of these fragments was constructed using the routine mapping 
      procedures. The physical map showed that the mitochondrial genome of Physarum was 
      linear with molecular weight of 45 . 10(6). We concluded therefore that the 
      mitochondrial nucleoid is a structure in which the homogeneous mtDNA is highly 
      amplified.

TI  - Amino-acid sequence data of beta-tubulin from Physarum polycephalum myxamoebae.
PG  - 669-79
AB  - Starting with 7.7 mg of a beta-tubulin isolated from myxamoebae of the slime mould 
      Physarum polycephalum, 90% of the sequence has been determined by the Edman 
      degradation of peptides generated by cyanogen bromide, trypsin and Staphylococcus 
      aureus protease. Differences to other beta-tubulins are mainly conservative and 
      spread evenly throughout the chain except for a high concentration at the 
      C-terminus. The Physarum beta-tubulin shows most homology to Chlamydomonas 
      beta-tubulin (90.5%) and least homology to yeast beta-tubulin (S. cerevisiae, 
      73.4%). Two tryptic peptides were isolated in approximately equal quantities which 
      were identical except in one position (S/ALTVPELTQRMFDA) showing that at least two 
      beta-tubulins are present in myxamoebae. However, since this was the only 
      heterogeneity found, these beta-tubulins are probably very similar.

TI  - Regulation of protein synthesis in the plasmodial phase of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 529-34
AB  - 1. The rate of protein synthesis changes very little during the first 2-3 h (S 
      phase) of the nuclear division cycle in plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum and then 
      increases continuously during G2 phase, so that by the end of the cycle the rate has 
      doubled relative to that in S phase. Protein synthesis appears to continue during 
      mitosis. 2. Fractionation of extracts of plasmodia, labeled with [3H]lysine for 1 h, 
      by two-dimensional electrophoresis indicated that most if not all proteins are 
      synthesised throughout the nuclear division cycle. However, two metabolically stable 
      polypeptides, the synthesis of which occurs predominantly in Gs phase, were 
      detected. 3. Using a double-labelling procedure, the differential rates of synthesis 
      of 30 relatively abundant polypeptides were measured in relation to the nuclear 
      division cycle. As a group, their differential rates of synthesis increase during 
      the cycle so that their actual rates of synthesis increase 4-6-fold. This implies 
      that their synthesis is regulated over and above any simple change due to a doubling 
      in the number of genes during S phase.

TI  - The chemotactic response of plasmodia of the myxomycete Physarum polycephalum to 
      sugars and related compounds.
PG  - 17-25
AB  - A new technique, the double strip method, for studying the chemotaxis of myxomycete 
      plasmodia is described. Physarum polycephalum was attracted by the aldohexoses 
      D-glucose, D-galactose and D-mannose and their derivatives 2-deoxy-D-glucose and 
      maltose, thresholds ranging from 0.25 mM (D-glucose) to 5 mM (D-mannose). These 
      sugars competed with each other, a uniform background of one of them inhibiting 
      taxis to the others. Other attractants were N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and mannitol, 
      with thresholds at 1 mM, and fucose (6-deoxy-D-galactose). Although in general only 
      those carbohydrates which could support growth were attractants, there were 
      exceptions such as 2-deoxy-D-glucose; hence metabolism of a compound was not 
      necessary for attraction. In addition, some compounds, such as fructose, could be 
      metabolized but did not attract. At high concentrations (about 100 mM) all the 
      compounds tested, including attractants, could under appropriate conditions cause 
      repulsion, probably through osmotic effects.

TI  - Ribosomal RNA genes in the amoebal and plasmodial forms of the slime mould Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 459-65
AB  - 1. The degree of homology between ribosomal RNA isolated from microplasmodia and 
      amoebae of the slime mould Physarum polycephalum has been determined by competive 
      hybridisation of the RNA from the two sources to homologous DNA in solution. The 
      extent of competition was measured both by hybridisation to saturation and by 
      following the kinetics of hybrid formation. In each case competition was found to be 
      100%, indicating that the ribosomal RNAs from the two, quite different vegetative 
      forms of the organism exhibit a high degree of homology and are probably transcribed 
      from the same genes. 2. The relationship between the amount of nuclear DNA that 
      codes for ribosomal RNA (rDNA) and ploidy has been investigated in three strains of 
      P. polycephalum which exhibit a 1:2:5 variation in the amount of DNA per nucleus. 
      Ribosomal RNA saturation values were determined by hybridisation to DNA isolated 
      from prophase nuclei of plasmodia. The proportion of rDNA was found to be constant 
      at 0.16--0.18% of the total genome in the three strains.

TI  - Accessibility of ribosomal genes to trimethyl psoralen in nuclei of Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 211-20
AB  - We have probed the accessibility of the genes for rRNA in Physarum polycephalum by 
      using the photoreactive DNA cross-linking agent 4,5',8-trimethyl psoralen. Nuclei 
      isolated from actively growing Physarum were treated with trimethyl psoralen and 
      irradiated with 360-nm light in order to form cross-links. The palindromic, 
      extrachromosomal rDNA then was isolated, and the positions of cross-links were 
      determined by electron microscopy of the DNA under totally denaturing conditions. 
      The results indicate that the frequency of cross-linking, after correction for base 
      sequence bias of the reaction, is up to sixfold higher in the transcribed regions 
      than in the central or the terminal spacer regions. There is no detectable 
      heterogeneity among the different rDNA molecules or between the halves of a single 
      molecule. Cross-linked molecules invariably occur in a linear as opposed to a 
      cruciform structure. The preferential cross-linking of the transcribed region is 
      nearly eliminated in spherules, a dormant transcriptionally inactive form in the 
      Physarum life cycle.

TI  - Sequence organisation in nuclear DNA from Physarum polycephalum. Interspersion of 
      repetitive and single-copy sequences.
PG  - 247-57
AB  - Nuclear DNA from Physarum polycephalum is shown to contain three sequence components 
      by reassociation kinetic analysis; a foldback component consisting of 6% of the DNA, 
      a component with the properties of repetitive sequences comprising 31% of the DNA, 
      and a majority component containing 63% of the DNA which reassociates with the 
      kinetics characteristic of single-copy sequences. The complement of repetitive 
      sequences is comprised of about 80 families of repeated elements, each containing 
      approximately 1800 repeats per family. On average, these sequences are 6.4% richer 
      in guanine and cytosine than total Physarum nuclear DNA. The repetitive sequences 
      within a single family appear not to be identical, since on denaturation and 
      annealing they give rise to collections of heteroduplexes less stable than native 
      DNA. It is calculated that these duplexes are about 10% mismatched on average. 
      Hydroxyapatite binding of DNA fragments of different sizes containing reassociated 
      repeated elements demonstrates that these sequences are interspersed with 
      single-copy sequences in a large portion of the Physarum genome. These observations 
      are confirmed by direct examination of reassociated DNA using the electron 
      microscope. In this manner it is shown that repetitive sequence elements possess a 
      wide spectrum of lengths averaging 590 nucleotide residues, and they are separated 
      by intervening segments of DNA about 930 residues in length.

TI  - Distribution of inverted repeat sequences in nuclear DNA from Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 179-87
AB  - Inverted repeat sequences, capable of forming stable intra-chain foldback duplexes, 
      are shown using electron microscopy to be located in over 90% of fragments of 
      nuclear DNA from Physarum polycephalum. A statistical treatment of the data 
      indicates that, on average, foldback sequence foci are spaced every 7,000 
      nucleotides and that they are distributed uniformly amongst the DNA chains. The 
      majority of inverted repeat sequences give rise to the simple types of foldback 
      structure observed in DNA from other eukaryotic species, but a significant 
      proportion of the DNA fragments also contain novel foldback structures with a more 
      complex appearance, referred to as 'bubbled' hairpins. The latter structures appear 
      to be formed by the annealing of several distinct segments of homologous inverted 
      repeat sequence, each separated by interspersed non-foldback sequences of variable 
      sizes up to 15,000 nucleotides in length. The size, both of the foldback duplexes 
      and of the intervening single-chain segments of DNA, are not random. Instead, they 
      appear to form a regular, arithmetic series of lengths. These observations suggest 
      that the different segments of Physarum DNA from which foldback structures are 
      derived contain nucleotide sequences that share a highly ordered and unform pattern 
      of structural organisation. These regular units of organisation in Physarum DNA in 
      some cases extend over distances up to 50,000 nucleotides in length.

TI  - Identification of histone H1(0) in Physarum polycephalum. Its high level in the 
      plasmodial stage increases in amount and phosphorylation in the sclerotial stage.
PG  - 2349-54
AB  - An antiserum specific for the globular domain of the bovine very lysine-rich histone 
      subfraction H1(0) cross-reacted with a single protein band in the chromosomal 
      proteins isolated from microplasmodia of the true slime mold Physarum polycephalum. 
      Its amino acid composition was characteristic of a very lysine-rich histone which 
      supported its identification as Physarum H1(0). Unlike Physarum H1(0), which is 50% 
      larger than mammalian H1, Physarum H1(0) migrated very close to bovine H1(0) on 
      sodium dodecyl sulfate gels. In microplasmodia, the ratio of H1(0) to H1 was 0.66, 
      whereas in sclerotia H1(0)/H1 was 1.33. Furthermore, both H1 and H1(0) in sclerotia 
      were highly phosphorylated. The high level of H1(0) in the mitotically active 
      microplasmodia argues against the proposed role of H1(0) just as an inhibitor of DNA 
      replication. More probable is an association of H1(0) with quiescent but 
      transcriptionally competent chromatin which could also include cell cycle genes. 
      Hyperphosphorylation of H1 and H1(0) in sclerotia is probably required to maintain 
      an inactive condensed state which can be reversed by dephosphorylation to allow 
      transcriptionally competent chromatin to become available for expression.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of histones and other acid-soluble chromosomal 
      proteins from Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 263-71
AB  - Chromosomal basic proteins were isolated from amoebal and plasmodial stages of the 
      acellular slime mold Physarum polycephalum. Polyacrylamide electrophoresis on high 
      resolution acid-urea gels separated the five histone fractions in the sequence H1, 
      H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Under these electrophoretic conditions Physarum histones 
      migrated more like plant (rye) than animal (calf) histones. Furthermore, Physarum 
      histones H1, H2A, and H2B have higher molecular weights on sodium dodecyl sulfate 
      (SDS) gels than the corresponding calf fractions. No differences were detected 
      between amoebal and plasmodial histones on either acid-urea or SDS-polyacrylamide 
      gel electrophoresis. Amoebal basic proteins were fractionated by exclusion 
      chromatography. The five histone fractions plus another major acid-soluble 
      chromosomal protein (AS) were isolated. The Physarum core histones had amino acid 
      compositions more closely resembling those of the calf core histones than of rye, 
      yeast, or Dictyostelium. Although generally similar in composition to the plant and 
      animal H1 histones, the Physarum H1 had a lower lysine content. The AS protein was 
      extracted with 5% perchloric acid or 0.5 M NaCl, migrated between histones H3 and H4 
      on acid-urea polyacrylamide gels, and had an apparent molecular weight of 15 900 on 
      SDS gels. It may be related to a protein migrating near H1. Both somewhat resembled 
      the high mobility group proteins in amino acid composition.

TI  - Electron microscope observations on myosin from Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 648-63
AB  - Myosin has been separated from Physarum polycephalum actomyosin in confirmation of 
      the results of Hatano and Tazawa. In an intermediate step, myosin-enriched 
      actomyosin has also been obtained. The mean yield of free myosin was 4.4 mg from 100 
      g of mold. It was obtained as water-clear solutions at micro = 0.055 with calcium 
      ATPase activity of up to 0.5 microM P(i)/min per mg. Negatively stained preparations 
      were examined by electron microscopy. Physarum myosin in 0.5 M KCl interacted with 
      actin from rabbit skeletal muscle to form polarized arrowhead complexes similar to 
      but less regular than those of natural actomyosin from muscle or myosin-enriched 
      Physarum actomyosin. The Physarum myosin-enriched actomyosin at low ionic strength 
      displayed evidence of head-to-tail and tail-to-tail aggregation attributable to the 
      myosin component. Yet Physarum myosin alone did not produce detectable filaments at 
      micro = 0.055 at pH 7, 6.5, or 5.8, nor when dialyzed against 0.01 M ammonium 
      acetate, nor when the dielectric constant of the medium was reduced. However, 
      aggregation approaching the extent of 'thick filaments' up to 0.3 micro long was 
      found in some preparations of myosin-enriched actomyosin put into solutions 
      containing adenosine triphosphate. Myosin alone in such solutions did not form 
      filaments. The results are compatible with the idea that head-to-tail aggregations 
      are favored by actin-myosin interactions in Physarum, possibly due to alignment of 
      the extended or tail portions of this myosin molecule.

TI  - Immunologically-related nucleic acid-binding proteins associated with the nuclear 
      matrix of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 25-30
AB  - The nuclear matrix of Physarum polycephalum is composed of two abundant polypeptides 
      of 27 and 38 kDa as well as numerous minor polypeptides of various molecular weight. 
      By contrast, the nuclear matrix of vertebrates consists of three major (the lamins) 
      and many minor polypeptides mainly in the 60-70 kDa molecular weight range. In order 
      to better characterize the major nuclear matrix proteins of P. polycephalum and, 
      perhaps, define their relationship with the major nuclear matrix proteins of 
      vertebrates, we have purified the abundant nuclear matrix proteins of P. 
      polycephalum. In Western blot analyses, polyclonal antibodies raised against the 
      purified 27 kDa polypeptide recognised polypeptides of 50 kDa, 45 kDa and several 
      low molecular weight species (14-21 kDa) in the P. polycephalum nuclear matrix. The 
      polyclonal antibodies did not react with the other abundant nuclear matrix protein 
      of 38 kDa from P. polycephalum nor with polypeptides of the mouse nuclear matrix. 
      Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed that the major nuclear matrix proteins of 
      P. polycephalum were more basic than the major nuclear matrix proteins of 
      vertebrates, the lamins. Moreover, both the 27 and 38 kDa polypeptides are 
      post-translationally modified by either D-mannosyl or D-glycosyl moieties, and not 
      by phosphorylation as has been demonstrated for the vertebrate lamins. DNA-binding 
      assays further revealed that the immunologically related polypeptides of 50 kDa, 45 
      kDa, 27 kDa and low molecular weight species of 14-21 kDa preferentially bound 
      single-stranded DNA, but the 38 kDa polypeptide of Physarum matrix did not. Based on 
      these findings, we conclude that the abundant nuclear matrix protein of 27 kDa 
      belongs to a group of immunologically-related nucleic acid-binding proteins, and is 
      immunologically and functionally distinct from the other major nuclear matrix 
      protein of 38 kDa from P. polycephalum and the vertebrate lamins.

TI  - Complementation of Amoebal-Plasmodial Transition Mutants in PHYSARUM POLYCEPHALUM.
PG  - 409-19
AB  - Amoebae of the Myxomycete Physarum polycephalum differentiate to yield plasmodia in 
      two ways: in crossing, haploid amoebae of appropriate genotypes fuse to form diploid 
      plasmodia; in selfing, plasmodia form without amoebal fusion or increase in ploidy. 
      Amoebae carrying the mating-type allele matAh (formerly mt(h)) self efficiently, but 
      occasionally give rise to mutants that self at very low frequencies. Such 
      "amoebal-plasmodial transition" mutants were mixed in pairs to test their ability to 
      complement one another in the formation of plasmodia by crossing. The pattern of 
      crossing permitted 33 mutants to be assigned to four complementation groups 
      (aptA(-), npfA(-), npfB(-) and npfC(-)). Similar tests had previously proved only 
      partially successful, as crossing had occurred only rarely in mixtures of compatible 
      strains. The efficiency of complementation was greatly increased in the current work 
      by mixing strains that carried different alleles of a newly-discovered 
      mating-compatibility locus, matB; this locus had no effect on the specificity of 
      complementation. A possible interpretation of the complementation behavior of the 
      mutants is suggested.

TI  - The effect of actidione on mitosis in the slime mold Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 337-41
AB  - Actidione, reportedly a specific inhibitor of protein synthesis, was found to reduce 
      the incorporation of labeled amino acids into proteins of the slime mold Physarum 
      polycephalum without drastically inhibiting the incorporation of nucleic acid 
      precursors into RNA. This inhibitor was found to completely block the ensuing 
      mitosis if it was added at any time between telophase and late prophase. Plasmodia 
      given Actidione in late prophase (about the time of nucleolar dissolution) went on 
      through telophase to reconstruction even though nuclear amino acid incorporation was 
      drastically reduced during that period.

TI  - Alterations in superoxide dismutase, glutathione, and peroxides in the plasmodial 
      slime mold Physarum polycephalum during differentiation.
PG  - 413-9
AB  - Changes in the level of antioxidant defenses and the concentration of free radical 
      by-products were examined in differentiating (M3cVII and LU897 X LU863), 
      non-differentiating (LU887 X LU897), and heterokaryon microplasmodia of the slime 
      mold Physarum polycephalum during spherulation in salts-only medium. As 
      differentiation proceeded, superoxide dismutase activity increased by as much as 46 
      fold; glutathione concentration and the rate of oxygen consumption decreased; 
      cyanide-resistant respiration, hydrogen peroxide, and organic peroxide 
      concentrations increased. The non-differentiating culture failed to exhibit any of 
      these changes. A heterokaryon obtained by the fusion of differentiating and 
      non-differentiating strains was observed to differentiate at a very retarded rate 
      and to exhibit the changes observed in the spherulating strains at a correspondingly 
      slower rate. These observations suggest that a free radical mechanism may be 
      involved in the differentiation of Physarum microplasmodia into spherules.

TI  - Direct repeats surrounding the ribosomal RNA genes of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 2047-53
AB  - Sequence homology was found between the external transcribed spacer and the terminal 
      non-transcribed spacer of Physarum polycephalum rDNA. The homologous sequences were 
      located 2kb upstream from the 19s rRNA gene and 0.3kb downstream from 26S rRNA gene, 
      respectively, and were arranged in a direct repeat manner. Sequence analyses showed 
      that the direct repeats consisted of two parts: one was sequences of about 130bp 
      which showed over 90% sequence homology with each other. The other consisted mainly 
      of many tandem repeats of a 50 to 52bp unit. The direct repeat-rRNA genes-direct 
      repeat unit was found to be flanked by short direct repetitious sequences. Based on 
      these findings, the significance of the direct repeat is discussed in terms of 
      evolution of rDNA.

AB  - A Binding Protein (BP) of nearly 95,000 daltons interacts with the acid phosphatase 
      at the permissive temperature, elevating its molecular weight from 48,000 +/- 2,000 
      to 136,000 +/- 7,000 in CL and CHR strains of Physarum polycephalum plasmodia. The 
      same molecule has not been observed in the extracts of M3C VIII and K strains. 28-31 
      degrees C is the critical temperature range for the breaking of enzyme-BP 
      association in CL strains. This critical temperature is higher than 39 degrees C for 
      the extract of CHR strains. CHR BP recognizes and binds CL acid phosphatase as 
      strongly as CHR acid phosphatase. Km determination at 32 degrees C and 
      thermoinactivation patterns at 66 degrees C indicate that the BP has no apparent 
      regulatory role for the acid phosphatase activities. The presence or the absence of 
      the BP in some of the strains may be used as a marker in the genetical studies of 
      this organism.

TI  - Relation of cytoplasmic calcium to contractility in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 37-48
AB  - In a dumbbell-shaped plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum showing active shuttle 
      streaming Ca was precipitated with potassium pyroantimonate (K[Sb(OH)6]), and the 
      distribution of Ca between the cytoplasm and cellular organelles, especially 
      vacuoles, was examined by electron microscopy. The contracting half-mass, where many 
      empty vacuoles were present, was rich in the small Ca precipitates located in the 
      cytoplasm. The relaxing half-mass, where many Ca-containing vacuoles were present, 
      was poor in the cytoplasmic Ca precipitates. One half-mass of a dumbbell-shaped 
      plasmodium was treated with Ca ionophore, X-537A, and its effect on the motive force 
      for endoplasmic streaming and the distribution of Ca was investigated. The motive 
      force was increased by X-537A, but the period of shuttle streaming was not changed. 
      X-537A also induced a significant increase in the number of the cytoplasmic Ca 
      precipitates in the X-537A-treated contracting half-mass, so that the asymmetry of 
      the distribution of cytoplasmic Ca precipitates was enhanced. A large portion of the 
      vacuoles were empty in the contracting half-mass, and Ca-containing in the relaxing 
      one as in the case of the untreated plasmodium.

TI  - Connectin, an elastic protein of muscle. A connectin-like protein from the

PG  - 883-8
AB  - A completely sodium dodecyl sulfate-insoluble protein was obtained from plasmodia of 
      Physarum polycephalum. The amino acid composition of this protein was very similar 
      to that of connectin, an elastic protein of muscle. When the protein suspension was 
      treated with 6 M guanidine-HCl in the presence of 0.1 M 2-mercaptoethanol, 
      entanglements of very thin filaments, less than 5 nm in width, were observed under 
      an electron microscope. Since the network structure is almost the same as that of 
      isolated muscle connectin, this plasmodium protein can be regarded as forming an 
      elastic net structure. Using an antiserum against the insoluble protein, it appeared 
      to be located at the peripheral region of the plasmodium. This elastic net structure 
      may act as a cytoskeleton at the cytoplasmic surface of the plasmodium cell 
      membrane.

TI  - Synthesis of ribosomal RNA during the mitotic cycle on the slime mould Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 471-7
AB  - 1. An isotope dilution technique has been used to analyze the synthesis of 
      metabolically stable nucleic acids during the mitotic cycle in surface plasmodia of 
      the slime mould Physarum polycephalum. Microplasmodia that had been labelled with 
      [3H]uridine were used to prepare a surface culture, after a period of growth long 
      enough to ensure that radioactivity was present only in tRNA, rRNA and DNA. The 
      synthesis of rRNA or nuclear DNA during the growth of the surface plasmodium was 
      then followed by measuring the specific activity of the nucleic acid. 2. Synthesis 
      of rRNA during the mitotic cycle shows the following characteristics: (a) it is low 
      during the immediate period of nuclear division, (b) synthesis is then continuous 
      throughout interphase and (c)the rate of synthesis increases 5-6-fold between the 
      beginning and end of interphase. These results are discussed in relation to the 
      pattern of replication of the genes for rRNA. 3. Approximately 80% of the nuclear 
      DNA replicates during the first 90 min of the mitotic cycle; completion of 
      replication, however, occupies the remainder of interphase.

TI  - Phosphorylation of histone H1 through the cell cycle of Physarum polycephalum. 24 
      sites of phosphorylation at metaphase.
PG  - 5081-6
AB  - H1 phosphorylation has been studied through the precise nuclear division cycle of 
      Physarum polycephalum. The number of sites of phosphorylation of Physarum H1 is very 
      much larger than the number of sites reported for mammalian H1 molecules which is 
      consistent with the larger molecular weight of Physarum H1. At metaphase all of the 
      Physarum H1 molecules contain 20-24 phosphates. Immediately following metaphase, 
      these metaphase-phosphorylated H1 molecules undergo rapid dephosphorylation to give 
      an intermediate S phase set of phosphorylated H1 molecules containing 9-16 
      phosphates. Progressing into S phase newly synthesized H1 is phosphorylated and 
      eventually merges with the old dephosphorylated H1 to give a ladder of bands 1-20. 
      By the end of S phase or early G2 phase, there is a ladder of bands 1-16 all of 
      which undergo phosphate turnover. Further into G2 phase the bands move to higher 
      states of phosphorylation, and by prophase all of the H1 molecules contain 15-24 
      phosphates which increases to 20-24 phosphates at metaphase. These results support 
      the proposals that H1 phosphorylation is an important factor in the process of 
      chromosome condensation through G2 phase, prophase to metaphase.

TI  - Contractile and structural reactions to impediments of Ca2+-homeostasis in Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 255-65
AB  - A combined application of 5 mM KCN and 19 microM Ca++-ionophore A-23187 leads to 
      pronounced contractures of plasmodial strands of Physarum polycephalum. The 
      appearance of the contractures is independent of the amount of Ca++ in the external 
      medium. Tensiometric registrations of longitudinal contraction activity (isometric 
      regime) reveal an average tension increase of 50 mp compared with the preceding 
      tension level before the addition of KCN and ionophore. This high force output 
      during the contracture coincides with a pronounced increase in the number of 
      cytoplasmic actomyosin fibrils. Their ultrastructure is seen as a high lateral 
      density of strictly parallel arranged F-actin filaments; the state of cytoplasmic 
      actomyosin during this isometric contracture corresponds to the ultrastructure of 
      isometrically contracted fibrils during the normal contraction-relaxation cycle of 
      this organism. A simultaneous impediment of respiration and Ca++ homeostasis 
      strongly favours a shift of the actin equilibrium to the high polymeric side in the 
      form of fibrils and may thus be used as a preparatory step improving the specimens 
      in the context of other investigations, e.g., for immunocytochemical investigations 
      or for the preparation of cell-free models to be reactivated after extraction 
      procedures.

TI  - Ca2+-dependent actin-binding phosphoprotein in Physarum polycephalum. II. 
      Ca2+-dependent f-actin-capping activity of subunit a and its regulation by 
      phosphorylation of subunit b.
PG  - 10151-8
AB  - Cap 42 (a + b), a Ca2+-dependent, actin-binding and phosphorylatable protein 
      consisting of two distinct subunits a and b of 42,000 Da in Physarum polycephalum, 
      has been identified as a new F-actin-capping protein. It capped or bound to the fast 
      growing ends of actin filaments and blocked actin polymerization at this end. The 
      capping activity residing in subunit a and its Ca2+-dependency were regulated by 
      phosphorylation of subunit b; subunit a required Ca2+ for its capping activity when 
      subunit b was phosphorylated, whereas this activity became Ca2+ independent when 
      subunit b was dephosphorylated. Subunit b contained at least two phosphorylatable 
      threonine residues and probably three additional phosphorylation sites. Like 
      cytochalasins and other F-actin-capping proteins, Cap 42 (a + b) was able to induce 
      a rapid depolymerization of actin filaments at the slow growing end, and also to 
      nucleate actin polymerization. However, unlike Physarum fragmin, Cap 42 (a + b) had 
      no severing activity leading to the fragmentation of actin filaments. Our results 
      indicate that Cap 42 (a + b) is the first Ca2+-dependent F-actin-capping 
      phosphoprotein whose phosphorylation regulates its actin-binding and vice versa. A 
      possible mechanism of the capping action of Cap 42 (a + b) in vitro and also its 
      conceivable role in the regulation of the Ca2+/actin-dependent cytoplasmic streaming 
      in plasmodia are discussed.

TI  - Change in phosphorylation of nucleolar proteins of Physarum polycephalum during the 
      cell cycle in vivo and in vitro.
PG  - 1579-86
AB  - We compared the phosphorylation of nucleolar proteins during the cell cycle of 
      Physarum polycephalum labeled by pulse and continuous labeling methods in vivo with 
      that obtained by in vitro labeling of isolated nucleoli. Both the phosphorylating 
      activity of nucleoli and total incorporation of radioactive phosphate into nucleolar 
      proteins increased and reached a maximum about 1.5-2.0 h before mitosis, confirming 
      our previous observation. Analyses of labeled nucleolar proteins by 
      SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by autoradiography indicated that most of 
      the phosphoproteins labeled by in vitro labeling were labeled by in vivo pulse 
      labeling. At least 10 nucleolar proteins underwent phosphorylation, which closely 
      followed the cell cycle-dependent changes of the total phosphate incorporation into 
      the nucleolar proteins. When mitosis was delayed by UV-irradiation, the maximal 
      incorporation of radioactive phosphate into nucleolar proteins in vivo was not 
      observed at the usual time, it shifted to about 2 h before the delayed mitosis, and 
      the same set of nucleolar proteins that were phosphorylated without UV-irradiation 
      were most heavily phosphorylated at this time. These results suggest the possibility 
      that the increased phosphorylation of nucleolar proteins of Physarum just before 
      mitosis is related to the onset of subsequent mitosis.

TI  - Mitochondrial DNA of Physarum polycephalum: physical mapping, cloning and 
      transcription mapping.
PG  - 331-7
AB  - Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been isolated from four strains of Physarum 
      polycephalum and a restriction site map has been determined using nine restriction 
      enzymes. The restriction site maps of the four strains are similar but each strain 
      is distinguished by insertions, deletions and restriction enzyme site polymorphisms. 
      The sum of the restriction fragments gives mitochondrial genome sizes which vary 
      from about 56 kb to 62 kb. In all four strains the composite map of the restriction 
      enzyme sites for the mtDNA is circular. Knowledge of the restriction enzyme map has 
      enabled cloning of mtDNA fragments representing the entire mtDNA of strain M3. The 
      cloned fragments have been used to create a transcription map of the mtDNA.

TI  - Recurrent senescence in axenic cultures of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 811-5
AB  - When subcultures of the aux-2 and aux-4 strains of Physarum polycephalum, which had 
      been grown for more than four years in axenic shake culture, were transferred to 
      non-axenic surface culture they displayed progressively shorter lifespans (older 
      axenic surface cultures yield shorter lived non-axenic cultures). Similar 
      subcultures transferred to axenic agar medium also underwent senescent-like events. 
      These subcultures, after a period of vigorous growth, displayed a slower growth 
      rate, reduced cytoplasmic streaming, loss of yellow pigment, and eventually they 
      fragmented into a number of small spherical structures with the concomitant lysis of 
      most of the plasmodium. In non-axenic culture these structures quickly degenerated 
      (and disappeared from the culture); however, in axenic culture they revived and 
      after several days produced new vigorous plasmodia. Following a period of vigorous 
      growth the plasmodium again underwent senescent-like events. This cycle of 
      senescence and growth was repeated a number of times before death finally occurred.

TI  - Regulation of mitosis onset and thymidine kinase synthesis during the cell cycle of 
      Physarum polycephalum: action of aphidicolin.
PG  - 82-9
AB  - In Physarum polycephalum (Myxomycetes) aphidicolin has been found to delay metaphase 
      onset when applied to synchronous plasmodia 3 h before control metaphase. In 
      contrast to the action of temperature shifts, aphidicolin treatment did not delay 
      the initiation of the increase of thymidine kinase synthesis (EC 2.7.1.21, 
      ATP-thymidine 5' phosphotransferase) and the decrease of the synthesis of thymidine 
      kinase occurred normally after completion of mitosis in presence of aphidicolin. The 
      amount of thymidine kinase synthesized was larger for aphidicolin treated plasmodia 
      than in the control due to both a longer period of increased synthesis and a higher 
      maximum rate of synthesis. These results were interpreted by postulating the 
      presence of two regulatory pathways. The first one acting on the increase of the 
      synthesis of thymidine kinase and on mitosis onset was sensitive to temperature 
      shifts from 22 to 32 degrees C. The second one acting on mitosis onset only was 
      sensitive to aphidicolin.

AB  - The nuclear cycle kinetics of Physarum polycephalum plasmodia were examined using 
      flow cytofluorometry. The dyes Hoechst 33342 and propidium iodide were used to stain 
      the DNA of isolated nuclei. In asynchronously growing microplasmodia. S phase 
      consists of 13--15% of the nuclear division cycle time. Nuclei isolated from 
      individual macroplasmodia, which have previously been demonstrated to divide in 
      synchrony, were shown to be less synchronized during late S phase than during 
      mitosis. The results obtained demonstrate the feasibility of flow cytometric 
      measurement of the properties of nuclei isolated from a single cell.

AB  - 1. Coupled mitochondria were isolated from exponentially growing Physarum 
      polycephalum. 2. Activity of malate dehydrogenase (oxalacetate reduction) was 10.9 
      mumol/min/mg protein; the apparent Km was 64 microM. 3. The activity of 
      NADP-isocitric dehydrogenase (IDH) was 110 nmol/min/mg with apparent Km of 35 
      microM. 4. NAD-IDH showed allosteric properties with AMP as a positive modulator. 
      The apparent Km for the unmodulated activity, 2 mM, was decreased to 0.95 mM by 0.13 
      mM AMP. 5. Succinic dehydrogenase activity was estimated as three times higher than 
      that of alpha-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase. 6. Mitochondria contained significant 
      amounts of phenolic compounds. Protein estimation by the Bradford method is 
      recommended.

      not organized in a normal mitotic apparatus. Some other nuclear abnormalities are 
      described.

TI  - Histone genes in Physarum polycephalum: transcription and analysis of the flanking 
      regions of the two H4 genes.
PG  - 322-6
AB  - The histone H4 multigene family of Physarum polycephalum consists of two genes, H41 
      and H42. Both genes have an unusual structure in that they are interrupted by a 
      small intron. The structure of the P. polycephalum H4 genes is discussed and 
      compared to the structure of histone genes of other organisms. S1 nuclease analysis 
      was used to map the 5' and 3' ends of the histone H4 messengers. We show that the 
      histone H4 genes have a hybrid structure; they are interrupted by an intervening 
      sequence, as in replacement variant histone genes of higher eukaryotes, but their 5' 
      and 3' noncoding regions have the properties of replication-dependent histone genes: 
      the 5' and 3' leader and trailer sequences are short, possess a 3'-hyphenated dyad 
      symmetry element, and a CAGA sequence is found 3' to the hyphenated hairpin 
      structure. This report also provides evidence that both genes are expressed in late 
      G2 phase as well as in S phase and that their expression is temporally coordinated 
      and quantitatively similar during the cell cycle.

TI  - Cyclic AMP in the cell cycle of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 114-21
AB  - Cyclic AMP, [3H]thymidine incorporation, and DNA content were measured in the cell 
      cycle of Physarum polycephalum. A sensitive radioimmunoassay was employed to assay 
      cyclic AMP so that plasmodia could be assayed individually. In contrast to 
      previously published results (Lovely, J.R. and Threlfall, R.J. (1976) Biochem. 
      Biophys. Res. Commun. 71, 789-795), no pre-mitotic peak of cyclic AMP was detected. 
      In seven experiments levels of cyclic AMP showed only small changes in individual 
      experiments and ranged from 1-6 pmol/mg protein in different experiments. When 
      plasmodia in the immediate premitotic period were collected on the basis of nuclear 
      mitotic morphology, no evidence of a peak of cyclic AMP was found. Light was found 
      to increase plasmodial cyclic AMP in a rapid, transient fashion. However, the brief 
      exposure of cell cycle samples to light during collection did not induce any 
      apparent cell cycle specific peaks of cyclic AMP. Although the occurrence of 
      extremely rapid transient peaks of cyclic AMP in the cell cycle cannot be ruled out, 
      it appears likely that the P. polycephalum cell cycle can proceed normally without 
      major changes in cyclic AMP.

TI  - Flow cytometry reveals a high degree of genomic size variation and mixoploidy in 
      various strains of the acellular slime mold Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 481-5
AB  - High-resolution flow cytometry, using avian erythrocytes as an internal standard, 
      was employed to study constitutive genome size variation of G2-phase nuclei of 
      Physarum polycephalum strains during the macroplasmodial stage of their life cycle. 
      Our results document a previously unknown extent of genome size variation and 
      mixoploidy in this organism. The unimodal diploid strain Tu 291 displayed the 
      largest genome of the strains tested; in contrast, the Colonia strain displayed only 
      half of the Tu 291 G2-phase fluorescence, confirming its haploid nature. An 
      additional strain, derived from a recent cross between Lu897 and Lu898 amoebae, must 
      have arisen by selfing (propagation of only one of the parental genomes to the 
      macroplasmodial stage), since its nuclei display close to the haploid G2-phase DNA 
      content. The observation of a small fraction of corresponding diploid nuclei within 
      the haploid population of this strain, while maintained as microplasmodia, supports 
      the notion that meiosis in haploid strains may require the presence of diploid 
      nuclei. Two of the descendants of the prototype haploid Colonia strain, which were 
      kept for extended periods of time in submerse culture, proved to be near diploid and 
      mixoploid. Polyploidization and subsequent loss of DNA thus seems to contribute to 
      the extremes of genome size variation in Physarum. In addition to unimodal 
      fluorescence distributions, a number of diploid strains displayed bi- and even 
      trimodal distributions within harvests of a single G2-phase macroplasmodium. 
      Analysis of these mixoploid strains by means of gaussian curve-fitting suggests that 
      the smaller genome size differences in Physarum may arise in step-wise diminution of 
      DNA in approximate units of 3-5% of the original Tu 291 genome.

PG  - 105-13
AB  - Endogenous RNA polymerase activity of isolated nuclei from Physarum polycephalum was 
      determined at high (400 mM KCl) and low (5--100 mM KCl) ionic strength. The activity 
      of RNA polymerase B (alpha-amanitin-sensitive UMP incorporation) and of RNA 
      polymerase A (plus C) (alpha-amanitin-resistant UMP incorporation) was compared in 
      accurately sized nuclear samples derived from macroplasmodia at distinct points of 
      the mitotic cycle. Minimum total RNA polymerase activity was detected in metaphase 
      nuclei. A constant level of RNA polymerase B activity was detected at all other 
      stages of the mitotic cycle, if nuclei were assayed at high ionic strength. However, 
      a high level in S-phase, a low level in G2-phase and again a high level in early 
      prophase were measured, if nuclei were assayed at low ionic strength. Inhibition of 
      DNA synthesis by hydroxyurea in vivo had a selective and drastic effect on in vitro 
      RNA polymerase activity of isolated nuclei derived from S-phase plasmodia, yielding 
      up to 100% inhibition in early S-phase.

TI  - Comparison of base specificity and other enzymatic properties of two protozoan 
      ribonucleases from Physarum polycephalum and Dictyostelium discoideum.
PG  - 141-5
AB  - Base specificity and other enzymatic properties of two protozoan RNases, RNase Phyb 
      from a true slime mold (Physarum polycephalum) and RNase DdI from a cellular slime 
      mold (Dictyostelium discoideum), were compared. These two RNases have high amino 
      acid sequence similarity (83 amino acid residues, 46%). The base specificities of 
      two base recognition sites, The B1 site (base recognition site for the base at 
      5'-side of scissile phosphodiester bond) and the B2 site (base recognition site for 
      the base at 3'-side of the scissile bond) of the both enzymes were estimated by the 
      rates of hydrolysis of 16 dinucleoside phosphates. The base specificities estimated 
      of B1 and B2 sites of RNase Phyb and RNase DdI were A, G, U > C and A > or = G > C > 
      U, and A > or = G, U > C and G > U > A, C, respectively. The base specificities 
      estimated from the depolymerization of homopolynucleotides and those from the 
      releases of four mononucleotides upon digestion of RNA coincided well with those of 
      the B2 sites of both enzymes. Thus, in these enzymes, the contribution of the B2 
      site to base specificity seems to be larger than that of the B1 site. pH-stability, 
      optimum temperature, and temperature stability, of both enzymes are discussed 
      considering that RNase Phyb has one disulfide bridge deleted, compared to the RNase 
      DdI with four disulfide bridges.

TI  - Cyclic 3',5'-AMP phosphodiesterase in Physarum polycephalum. I. Chemotaxis toward 
      inhibitors and cyclic nucleotides.
PG  - 332-41
AB  - The effect of several inhibitors of the enzyme cyclic 3',5'-AMP phosphodiesterase as 
      chemoattractants in Physarum polycephalum was examined. Of the compounds tested, 
      4-(3-butoxy-4-methoxybenzyl)-2-imidazolidinone (Roche 20-1724/001) and 
      1-ethyl-4-(isopropylidinehydrazino)-1H-pyrazolo-(3,4-b)-pyridine-5-carboxylic acid 
      ethyl ester, hydrochloride (Squibb 20009) were the most potent attractants. 
      3-Isobutyl-1-methyl xanthine, theophylline, and morin (a flavanoid) were moderate 
      attractants and sometimes gave negative chemotaxis at high concentrations. Cyclic 
      3',5'-AMP was an effective, but not potent attractant. A repellent effect following 
      the positive chemotactic action was sometimes observed with cyclic 3',5'-AMP at 
      concentrations as high as 1 . 10(-2) M. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP appeared to be a 
      somewhat more potent attractant than cyclic 3',5'-AMP. The 8-thiomethyl and 
      8-bromoderivatives of cyclic AMP, which are poorly hydrolyzed by the 
      phosphodiesterase, were not attractants in Physarum. Possible participation of 
      cyclic 3',5'-AMP in the directional movement in P. polycephalum is discussed.

TI  - Phosphorylation of ribosomal proteins S3, L1 and L24 during spherulation in Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 87-93
AB  - The phosphate content of ribosomal proteins S3, L1 and L24 has been determined in 
      the course of spherulation of Physarum polycephalum. The major phosphoprotein, S3, 
      was completely dephosphorylated after 4 h of differentiation. The phosphate content 
      of L1 and L24 was not altered during the differentiation. The cellular level of ATP 
      remained constant for at least 5 h. A 3-fold reduction of cyclic AMP concentration 
      occurred in the first hour, followed by a slow increase to a final value of twice 
      the level observed in growing cells. The results showed that the phosphorylation of 
      ribosomal proteins is regulated by at least two different mechanisms and that the 
      dephosphorylation of S3 is not induced by a lack of cellular ATP. Although cyclic 
      AMP might trigger the dephosphorylation of S3, the phosphate content of this protein 
      remained at a very low value even when the cellular concentration of cyclic AMP rose 
      significantly. Since the polysome level remains constant during the first 24 h of 
      spherulation, the phosphorylation of S3 is not necessary for active protein 
      synthesis and the phosphorylation of L1 and L24 is not involved in ribosome 
      inactivation, which occurs after 24 h.

TI  - Nuclear pores during the cell cycle in a slime mold, physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 431-9
AB  - Freeze-fracture and thin sectioning techniques were used to follow in large 
      synchronous plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum the changes in number and 
      distribution of nuclear pores during the cell cycle. Using freeze-fracture, we 
      determined that average pore frequency rises gradually from 14/micrometers(2) of 
      nuclear envelope surface at early S to a value of about 22 just before prophase. 
      Nuclear diameter averaged 3.3 micrometers at early S and increased to 4.3 
      micrometers at late G2. Calculating nuclear volume and average chromatin volume per 
      nucleus with respect to time in the cell cycle leads to the conclusion that number 
      of nuclear pores appears to be most directly related to amount of chromatin present 
      per nucleus and to be independent of nuclear surface area.

TI  - Minor components of the DNA of Physarum polycephalum. Cellular location and 
      metabolism.
PG  - 484-96
AB  - DNA metabolism in the slime mold Physarum polycephalum was studied by centrifugation 
      in CsCl of lysates of cultures labeled with radioactive thymidine at various times 
      in the cell cycle. During the G(2) (premitotic) phase of the cell cycle, two 
      components of the DNA are labeled. One component is lighter (buoyant density 1.686 
      g/cc) than the mean of the principal DNA (1.700 g/cc), and one is heavier 
      (approximately 1.706 g/cc). The labeled light DNA was identified chemically by its 
      denaturability, its susceptibility to DNase, and the recovery of its radioactivity 
      in thymine. Cell fractionation studies showed that the heavy and the principal DNA 
      components are located in the nucleus and that the light DNA is in the cytoplasm. 
      The light DNA comprises approximately 10% of the DNA. About (1/3)-(1/2) of the light 
      DNA is synthesized during the S period, and the remainder is synthesized throughout 
      G(2) (there is no G(1) in Physarum). The light DNA is metabolically stable. A low, 
      variable level of incorporation of radioactive thymidine into the principal, nuclear 
      DNA component was observed during G(2).

AB  - Physarum polycephalum belongs to Mycetozoans, a phylogenetic clade apart from the 
      animal, plant and fungus kingdoms. Histones are nuclear proteins involved in genome 
      organization and regulation and are among the most evolutionary conserved proteins 
      within eukaryotes. Therefore, this raises the question of their conservation in 
      Physarum and the position of this organism within the eukaryotic phylogenic tree 
      based on histone sequences. We carried out a comprehensive study of histones in 
      Physarum polycephalum using genomic, transcriptomic and molecular data. Our results 
      allowed to identify the different isoforms of the core histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 
      which exhibit strong conservation of amino acid residues previously identified as 
      subject to post-translational modifications. Furthermore, we also identified the 
      linker histone H1, the most divergent histone, and characterized a large number of 
      its PTMs by mass spectrometry. We also performed an in-depth investigation of 
      histone genes and transcript structures. Histone proteins are highly conserved in 
      Physarum and their characterization will contribute to a better understanding of the 
      polyphyletic Mycetozoan group. Our data reinforce that P. polycephalum is 
      evolutionary closer to animals than plants and located at the crown of the 
      eukaryotic tree. Our study provides new insights in the evolutionary history of 
      Physarum and eukaryote lineages.

TI  - Structure and expression of an actin gene of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 161-8
AB  - Physarum polycephalum (strain M3CVIII) contains four unlinked actin gene loci, each 
      with two alleles (ardA1, ardA2, ardB1, ardB2, ardC1, ardC2, ardD1 and ardD2). The 
      4800 base HindIII fragment of the ardC2 allele was previously isolated as a 
      recombinant phage lambda. We now report the structure of the actin gene sequences 
      (C-actin gene). The gene, which contains four intervening sequences, codes for the 
      principal actin isotype of plasmodia and it is expressed in both the haploid 
      myxamoebal and diploid plasmodial phases of the life cycle. The C-actin isotype is 
      closely related to actins of Dictyostelium, Acanthamoebae, Drosophila, sea urchin 
      and mammalian cytoplasmic actin, and more distantly related to actins of yeast, 
      Entamoebae and Tetrahymena. The ardC1 and ardC2 alleles differ by a 700(+/- 100) 
      base-pair insertion/deletion in the vicinity of the 3' end of the transcribed region 
      of the gene.

TI  - Purine metabolism in microplasmodia of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 269-77
AB  - The uptake and utilization of purine nucleosides and purines in microplasmodia of 
      Physarum polycephalum were investigated. The results revealed a unique pattern, 
      namely that exogenous purine nucleosides are readily taken up and metabolised, while 
      free purine bases are hardly taken up. The pathways of incorporation have been 
      elucidated in studies with whole cells and with cell-free extracts. The 
      ribonucleosides (adenosine, inosine and guanosine) can be converted into 
      ribonucleotides in two ways; either directly catalysed by a kinase or by a 
      phosphorolytic cleavage to the free base (adenine, hypoxanthine and guanine 
      respectively) which can then be activated by a purine phosphoribosyltransferase. 
      Apparently the purine phosphoribosyltransferases do not react with exogenous purine 
      bases. The deoxyribonucleosides (deoxyadenosine, deoxyinosine and deoxyguanosine) 
      are also phosphorolysed by purine nucleoside phosphorylase to adenine, hypoxanthine 
      and guanine respectively. A portion of deoxyadenosine is directly phosphorylated to 
      dAMP. It appears that only a minor part of the soluble nucleotide pool can be 
      synthesised from exogenous supplied nucleosides and that none of the 
      deoxyribonucleosides specifically label DNA. There is no catabolism of the purine 
      moiety. In agreement with the above findings, we have found that analoguees of 
      purine nucleosides are more toxic than their corresponding purine base analogues.

TI  - Selective gene expression during sporulation of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 4784-90
AB  - The two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of polypeptides synthesized in vitro from 
      poly(A)+ RNA showed that mRNA populations change during sporulation of Physarum 
      polycephalum. The differential hybridization of a cDNA library prepared from 
      poly(A)+ RNA isolated from sporulating cells revealed that of 846 clones, 64 
      corresponded to sporulation-specific mRNAs. Further analysis demonstrated that these 
      clones contained seven different sequences: three abundant sequences composing 3.2, 
      1.8, and 1.2% of the library and four other less abundant sequences. It is probable 
      that all the major mRNAs specifically expressed in early stages of sporulation were 
      identified. The most abundant mRNA from this group coded for a hydrophobic protein 
      that contained a signal peptide. This protein is 47% similar to another Physarum 
      protein, which was encoded by the most abundant plasmodium-specific mRNA. The 
      plasmodial mRNA was degraded during sporulation and was replaced by the sporulation 
      mRNA. These two proteins are thus encoded by members of a gene family whose 
      expression is developmentally regulated.

TI  - Temperature-sensitive mutants of Physarum polycephalum: viability, growth, and 
      nuclear replication.
PG  - 499-504
AB  - Using a selfing strain of Physarum polycephalum that forms haploid plasmodia, we 
      have isolated temperature-sensitive growth mutants in two ways. The negative 
      selectant, netropsin, was used to enrich for temperature-sensitive mutants among a 
      population of mutagenized amoebae, and, separately, a nonselective screening method 
      was used to isolate plasmodial temperature-sensitive mutants among clonal plasmodia 
      derived from mutagenized amoebae. Complementation in heterokaryons was used to sort 
      the mutants into nine functional groups. When transferred to the restrictive 
      temperature, two mutants immediately lysed, whereas the remainder slowed or stopped 
      growing. Of the two lytic mutants, one affected both amoebae and plasmodia, and the 
      other affected plasmodia alone. The growth-defective mutants were examined for 
      protein and deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis and for aberrations in mitotic behavior. 
      One mutant may be defective in both protein and deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis, and 
      another only in deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis. The latter shows a striking 
      reduction in the frequency of postmitotic reconstruction nuclei at the restrictive 
      temperature. We believe that this mutant, MA67, is affected in a step in the nuclear 
      replication cycle occurring late in G2. Execution of this step is necessary for both 
      mitosis and chromosome replication.

      characterization.
PG  - 224-33
AB  - An endonuclease, present in the microplasmodia of Physarum polycephalum, has been 
      partially purified from isolated nuclei by DEAE-cellulose and Sephadex G-75 
      chromatography. 1. The endonuclease produced single-strand scissions in 
      double-stranded DNA which resulted in the generation of 5'-phosphoryl and 
      3'-hydroxyl termini. No activity was observed with single-stranded DNA as substrate. 
      2. The pH optimum was approximately 8.5. 3. Divalent cations were essential for 
      enzyme activity. MnCl2 and MgCl2 gave maximal activity. CaCl2, ZnCl2 or CoCl2 did 
      not activate the enzyme. 4. The endonuclease activity was highly sensitive to 
      monovalent cations. 5. Endonuclease activity was found in two forms after gel 
      filtration: an activity in a homogeneous peak with a molecular weight of approx. 20 
      000, and an activity that had a heterogeneous molecular weight and which was 
      isolated in a complex with DNA. A possible function of the endonuclease in DNA 
      replication is discussed.

TI  - Isolation and Characterization of a Galactosamine Wall from Spores and Spherules of 
      Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 1119-25
AB  - The myxomycete, Physarum polycephalum, can be induced under laboratory conditions to 
      form two different hard-walled forms, spores and spherules. Characterization of both 
      types of walls revealed only a single sugar, galactosamine. It was identified after 
      acid hydrolysis of the isolated walls by chromatography in three solvent systems, by 
      its positive reaction with ammoniacal silver nitrate, ninhydrin, Galactostat, and 
      the Elson-Morgan test, and by ninhydrin degradation to lyxose. Galactosamine was 
      present as a polymer with solubility characteristics the same as the beta1-4-linked 
      glucosamine polymer (chitosan). The walls were also found to contain about 2% 
      protein. Spherule walls revealed a single glycoprotein on gel electrophoresis. Spore 
      walls contained a similar protein component. The phosphate content of isolated 
      spherule walls was 9.8%, and that of spore walls was 1.4%. Spore walls also 
      contained about 15% melanin which was shown to be similar to fungal melanin. A novel 
      method was used to measure the rate of mature spherule formation based on the loss 
      of extractability of P. polycephalum natural pigment. The presence of a rare 
      galactosamine polymer in P. polycephalum spore and spherule walls as the only 
      carbohydrate suggests that the myxomycetes are not closely related to the fungi or 
      the protozoa.

TI  - Immunoelectron microscopic localization of the nucleolar protein B-36 (fibrillarin) 
      during the cell cycle of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 119-26
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies raised against the 34-kD nucleolar protein, B-36, from the 
      slime mold Physarum polycephalum have been used to examine the electron microscopic 
      localization of B-36 during the cell cycle in Physarum. During interphase, B-36 is 
      found primarily in regions corresponding to the dense fibrillar component. This is 
      similar to what has been observed for the putative mammalian homologue of B-36, 
      fibrillarin. During mitosis, B-36 remains associated with perichromosomal nucleolar 
      remnants. With the Gautier DNA-specific staining procedure, the same nucleolar 
      remnants are shown to contain short DNA segments, presumably rDNA molecules. These 
      findings suggest that in Physarum, where the nucleolus is composed of several 
      hundred extrachromosomal rDNA molecules, the dense fibrillar component and the "NOR" 
      equivalents do not separate during mitosis as in mammalian cells. In addition, the 
      B-36-enriched nucleolar remnants appear to be recycled from one cell cycle to the 
      next.

TI  - The heterogeneity of cytoplasmic deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase from Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 445-51
AB  - Cytoplasmic DNA polymerase (DNA deoxynucleotidyltransferase, EC 2.7.7.7) was 
      partially purified from Physarum polycephalum. The first step of the purification 
      procedure utilized the fact that the enzyme on gel filtration behaves in anomalous 
      fashion. The second step was either ion-exchange chromatography or 
      sucrose-density-gradient centrifugation. The partially purified DNA polymerase was 
      heterogeneous and at least four species with different sedimentation coefficients 
      (5.5S, 7.2S, 8.6S and 11.5S) were detected. Calculated molecular weights indicated a 
      tendency for stoicheiometric polypeptide aggregation, accompanied by an alteration 
      of the three-dimensional structure froma compact spheroid to a more open elliptical 
      form. Sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis and computed 
      molecular weights suggest an active protomer in the range of 113000 daltons; all 
      data pertain to I 0.045, which was maintained during the whole procedure.

TI  - Growth of large plasmodia of the myxomycete Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 1411-8
AB  - A method has been developed for growing Physarum polycephalum plasmodia that are 8 
      to 10 times larger than those obtained in the petri dish cultures used by Nygaard, 
      Guttes, and Rusch. In the large-scale procedure, plasmodia were grown in metal trays 
      on a membrane supported by filter paper on stainless-steel screen. Plasmodia were 
      started from a ring of inoculum to allow inward and outward migration and were 
      incubated on a rocker so that nutrient medium would flow back and forth, wetting the 
      undersurface of the plasmodium. Rocker and petri dish cultures had similar growth 
      characteristics: (i) the interphase time between mitoses I and II and between II and 
      III was about 8 hr; (ii) ribonucleic acid and protein increased essentially 
      logarithmically throughout the cell cycle; and (iii) deoxyribonucleic acid increased 
      only during early interphase and it doubled in approximately 3 hr after each 
      mitosis. Rocker cultures were not as nearly synchronous as petri dish cultures and 
      had a range in metaphase time (at mitosis III) within individual plasmodia of 15 to 
      45 min, as compared with 5 to 10 min in petri dish cultures.

PG  - 579-89
AB  - Combined studies which include, NMR spectroscopy, circular dichroism, amino acid 
      analysis and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis together show that the protein 
      designated as histone H1 from Physarum polycephalum has many of the features of 
      histone H1 derived from other sources. The molecular masses of the globular peptide 
      and the whole molecule were found to be 9000 +/- 1000 Da and 33000 +/- 3000 Da 
      respectively. NMR melting experiments showed that the half-melt temperature was 53 
      +/- 1 degree C and the enthalpy of melting was 100 kJ . mol-1. Unusual facets of the 
      molecule are the relatively large numbers of histidine residues (6 or 7) and the 
      mono, di and trimethylation of some of the lysines, the major type of modification 
      being trimethylation of 9 +/- 2 residues. The conditions necessary for structuring 
      Physarum H1 are not the same as the histone H1 from calf thymus. It is suggested 
      that titration of the histidine residues is the most decisive step for the 
      development of tertiary folding of the globular unit.

PG  - 373-8
AB  - Using a differential extraction procedure which had previously been shown to yield 
      one nucleic acid fraction enriched in cytoplasmic RNA and another enriched in 
      nuclear RNA, we have been able to isolate two polyadenylated RNA populations from 
      microplasmodia of Physarum polycephalum. The poly(A)-containing RNA from the 
      cytoplasmic-enriched fraction accounts for approximately 1.2% of the cytoplasmic 
      nucleic acid, has a number-average nucleotide size of 1339+/- 39 nucleotides, and 
      has been shown, in a protein-synthesizing system in vitro, to be capable of 
      directing the synthesis of peptides which have also been shown to be synthesized in 
      vivo by microplasmodia. The poly(A)-containing RNA from the nuclear-enriched 
      fraction has a number-average nucleotide size of 1533 +/- 104 nucleotides and 
      represents a mixture of cytoplasmic and nuclear adenylated RNA molecules. Based upon 
      these observations, we have identified the polyadenylated RNA isolated from the 
      fraction enriched in cytoplasmic nuclei acid as Physarum poly(A)-containing 
      messenger RNA.

TI  - Laser light-scattering analysis of protoplasmic streaming in the slime mold Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 212-24
AB  - Laser light scattering is shown to be an effective means of obtaining a rapid, 
      objective assessment of dynamic changes in the intact plasmodium of the myxomycete 
      Physarum polycephalum during bidirectional (shuttle) streaming. The motion of 
      material in a 100 mum diameter region of a plasmodial vein was studied by following 
      changes in the autocorrelation function of the fluctuations in the scattered light 
      intensity. The autocorrelation function was recorded at 10 s intervals and analyzed 
      to follow changes in the flow velocity of protoplasm associated with shuttle 
      streaming. Rhythmic velocity changes and a "beating" pattern of velocity maxima were 
      readily observed. In an attempt to locate the site of underlying structural changes 
      in the vein responsible for the changing pattern of flow, the average scattered 
      intensity was separated into components derived from moving and stationary 
      scatterers. Periodic variations in the light intensity due to stationary scatterers 
      are related to the streaming cycle and indicate the occurrence of important 
      structural changes in the vein walls. Two possible interpretations of the data are 
      offered; one involving gross dynamic changes in vein structure, the other involving 
      the formation, contraction, or breakdown of fibrillar material in the vein wall 
      during the streaming cycle.

TI  - Superoxide dismutase induces differentiation in microplasmodia of the slime mold 
      Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 205-11
AB  - Evidence is presented that supports a role for the enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) 
      in the differentiation of the slime mold, Physarum polycephalum. SOD activity 
      increases 46-fold during differentiation. A strain of Physarum that does not 
      differentiate exhibits no change in SOD activity. Addition of SOD, via liposomes, to 
      the nondifferentiating strain induces differentiation; this effect is enhanced by an 
      inhibitor of glutathione synthesis. Other antioxidants selected for study failed to 
      induce differentiation. Conversely, oxidative treatments including introduction of 
      D-amino acid oxidase, via liposomes, induced differentiation. Cellular oxidation is 
      the probable cause of the SOD effect.

TI  - A method for isolation of nuclei containing undegraded RNA from RNAase-rich 
      plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 403-10
AB  - (1) In order to protect the nuclear RNA of Physarum polycephalum plasmodia during 
      cell homogenisation and purification of the nuclei, the following conditions were 
      used: low temperature (-11 degrees C), high pH (8.1-8.9), formaldehyde (2.8%) and 
      spermine (2.3 mM). (2) The efficiency of these RNAase-inhibiting and inactivating 
      conditions is demonstrated by the high molecular weight of the processing products 
      of transcripts from ribosomal genes (11.9, 9.5 and 5.0 kilobases), which were 
      recovered from the isolated nuclei and visualised on agarose gels. (3) Hybridisation 
      experiments with a DNA probe from an actin gene on size-fractionated nuclear RNA 
      (Northern blots) indicate that the transcripts from actin genes are rapidly spliced 
      in P. polycephalum. (4) The nuclear polyadenylated RNA has an average size of about 
      2.2 kb, which is not significantly larger than the average length of mRNA.

TI  - Ca2+-dependent actin-binding phosphoprotein in Physarum polycephalum. I. 
      Ca2+/actin-dependent inhibition of its phosphorylation.
PG  - 10144-50
AB  - When crude extracts of the slime mold Physarum polycephalum were incubated with ATP 
      and Mg2+ at 35 degrees C, a peptide of approximately 42,000 Da was predominantly 
      phosphorylated. The kinase, separated from the phosphorylatable peptide, 
      phosphorylated neither actin nor fragmin, both proteins of 42,000 Da, the latter 
      known to cap and shorten actin filaments in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The 
      phosphorylatable peptide was phosphorylated only at threonine residue(s), and its 
      phosphorylation was almost completely inhibited by micromolar concentrations of Ca2+ 
      in the extracts. The Ca2+-dependent inhibition of the phosphorylation was reversed 
      by the subsequent addition of ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl 
      ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid but not by trifluoperazine. The Ca2+-dependent 
      inhibition of the phosphorylation required either actin or another, so far 
      unidentified, protein(s) which is distinct from calmodulin. Fragmin reversed the 
      Ca2+/actin-dependent inhibition of the phosphorylation. The Ca2+-dependent 
      actin-binding phosphorylatable protein named Cap 42 (a + b), consisting of two 
      distinct 42,000-Da peptides a and b, was purified to near homogeneity. Peptide b was 
      identified as the phosphorylatable subunit. Substoichiometric amounts of Cap 42 (a + 
      b) reduced the low shear viscosity of F-actin solutions.

TI  - Structural organization of a hypermethylated nuclear DNA component in Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 1157-65
AB  - Digestion of Physarum polycephalum nuclear DNA using the restriction endonuclease 
      HpaII generates two components, distinguishable on the basis of their molecular 
      size. The high-molecular-weight, HpaII-resistant component, which accounts for 20% 
      of the DNA, contains a fivefold greater concentration of 5-methylcytosine residues 
      than the low-molecular-weight HpaII-digested fraction. Segments of hypermethylated 
      (M+) DNA are largely composed of a single, long, highly repeated sequence, and this 
      major element is sometimes associated with other less highly repetitive sequences in 
      the M+ DNA fraction. Restriction mapping of cloned Physarum M+ DNA segments, and 
      Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA using subcloned segments of M+ DNA as a probe, 
      provide evidence for sequence variation within different copies of the dominant 
      highly repeated element, and possibly the other associated repeats in M+ DNA, and 
      additionally that almost complete tandemly repeated copies of the major repeat are 
      found in some M+ DNA segments.

TI  - Sequence organisation in nuclear DNA from Physarum polycephalum: methylation of 
      repetitive sequences.
PG  - 801-14
AB  - Nuclear DNA from the slime mould Physarum polycephalum is digested by the 
      restriction endonuclease HpaII to generate a high molecular weight and a low 
      molecular weight component. These are referred to as the M+ and the M- compartment, 
      respectively. Sequences that are present in the M+ compartment are cleaved by MspI, 
      the restriction enzyme isoschizomer of HpaII, thus showing that the recognition 
      sequences for these enzymes in M+ DNA contain methylated CpG doublets. The 
      distribution of repetitive sequences in the M+ and M- DNA compartments was 
      investigated by comparison of the 'fingerprint' patterns of total Physarum DNA and 
      isolated M+ DNA after digestion using different restriction endonucleases, and by 
      probing for the presence of specific repetitive sequences in Southern blots of M+ 
      and M- DNA by the use of cloned DNA segments. Both types of experiment indicate that 
      many repetitive sequences are shared by both compartments, though some repetitive 
      sequences appear to be considerably enriched, or are present exclusively, either in 
      M+ DNA or in M- DNA.

TI  - Premature replication of late S period DNA regions in early S nuclei transferred to 
      late S cytoplasm by fusion in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 158-73
AB  - Fusion of a late S period plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum to an early S period 
      plasmodium causes premature replication of late S replicating regions in the nuclei 
      of the early S plasmodium. The extent of ahead-of-schedule replication of late S 
      replicating regions in early S period nuclei increases to a plateau of 16-20% for 
      fusions with 40-70 min of phase difference, then declines for larger phase 
      differences. The stimulatory factors for late S replicative units are present only 
      in late S plasmodia and appear to act only on late S regions. Once replicated, early 
      S replicating regions are not stimulated to replicate again by fusion to a 
      plasmodium entering the S period. Our data do not discriminate between 
      anti-termination of replication by factors of stop sites on long replicons, and a 
      sequential initiation of replication on new, possibly non-adjacent regions, but does 
      provide evidence that the stimulatory factors are distinct from one another and 
      specific for certain target replicative units.

TI  - Primary structure of profilins from two species of Echinoidea and Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 777-81
AB  - Profilin is a small G-actin-binding protein, the amino acid sequence of which was 
      previously reported for calf, human, Acanthamoeba and yeast. Here the amino acid 
      sequences of three profilins obtained from eggs of two species of Echinoidea, 
      Clypeaster japonicus (order, Clypeasteroida) and Anthocidaris crassispina (order, 
      Echinoida), and plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum were determined. Two echinoid 
      profilins were composed of 139 amino acid residues, N-termini were acylated and the 
      molecular mass was calculated to be 14.6 kDa, slightly larger than that of 13 kDa 
      estimated by SDS/PAGE [Mabuchi, I. & Hosoya, H. (1982) Biomed. Res. 3, 465-476]. On 
      the other hand, Physarum profilin was composed of 124 amino acid residues, the 
      N-terminus was acylated, and the calculated molecular mass was 13132 Da. The 
      sequences of C. japonicus and A. crassispina profilins were homologous (84% 
      identical). However, the similarity of these profilins with those form other 
      organisms was low. The sequence of Physarum profilin was homologous with 
      Acanthamoeba profilin isoforms (51% identical) and with yeast profilin (42% 
      identical), but not with other profilins. The relatively conservative sequence of 
      profilins from yeast, Physarum, Acanthamoeba, echinoid eggs and mammalian cells was 
      found in the N-terminal region, which was suggested to be a common actin-binding 
      region. The C-terminal region was also conserved, although to a lesser extent than 
      the N-terminal region.

TI  - Nuclear acidic protein changes during differentiation in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 1233-6
AB  - A class of acidic nuclear phosphoproteins has been isolated throughout the mitotic 
      cycle and at two points during differentiation in the slime mold Physarum 
      polycephalum. The electrophoretic profiles of these proteins are reproducible and 
      unchanging throughout the mitotic cycle, but reproducible changes occur during 
      differentiation. The proteins are rapidly synthesized after mitosis, and their 
      molecular weights range from 34,000 to 88,000. The proteins rapidly incorporate 
      [(32)P]orthophosphate, and the content of alkali-labile phosphate increases 20 
      percent during the period after DNA synthesis. The proteins comprise 6.5 percent by 
      dry weight of nuclear material while the DNA comprises about 5.5 percent. These 
      acidic nuclear proteins may have a role in control of gene activity.

TI  - Nucleotide sequence of a ribosomal RNA gene intron from slime mold Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 1376-80
AB  - The Physarum polycephalum 26S ribosomal RNA gene contains two intervening sequences 
      (introns). The DNA sequence of one of these introns was analyzed together with that 
      of its flanking regions (exons). In addition, the nucleotide sequence of the 
      corresponding region of the reverse transcript of 26S rRNA was determined, and from 
      comparisons of both sequences the precise location and size of the intron were 
      determined. Our findings, when compared with those for Tetrahymena and Chlamydomonas 
      rRNA gene introns, led to the conclusion that certain characteristics exist near the 
      ends of these introns. (i) An exon ends in T at the exon/intron junction and an 
      intron ends in G at the intron/exon junction in all cases. (ii) For each intron, 
      direct repeats several nucleotides long are present 5 to approximately 30 
      nucleotides upstream from both the exon/intron and intron/exon junctions.

TI  - Purification of an alkaline nuclease from Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 359-67
AB  - An alkaline nuclease was purified from microplasmodia of Physarum polycephalum. The 
      nuclease, active on denatured DNA and RNA and free of contamination by other 
      nucleolytic activities, appeared to be a zinc-metallo protein. The enzyme was only 
      active under conditions, where Zn2+ were retained in the enzyme. Loss of zinc 
      occurred by the chelating action of EDTA, EGTA or ampholines, by acid of highly 
      alkaline pH conditions or by high ionic strength. The addition of ZnCl2 to 
      compensate losses, restored all activity, while all other divalent cations caused 
      inhibition. The nuclease, with a molecular weight of 32 000, was stable at neutral 
      pH at high temperatures with a half-life of 20 min at 80 degrees C. It was inhibited 
      by any salt of buffer concentration above the level of zero ionic strength and 
      showed a special sensitivity towards phosphate ions. The possible similarity of this 
      enzyme to nuclease S1 from Aspergillus oryzae is pointed out.

TI  - Expression of the three unlinked isocoding actin genes of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 317-28
AB  - The actin gene family in Physarum polycephalum contains four unlinked loci: ardA, 
      ardB, ardC, and ardD. The ardA locus is complex and probably contains two genes 
      which we designated ardA2-7 and ardA2-17. cDNA clones corresponding to the ardB and 
      ardC loci were isolated. Nucleic acid sequencing showed that these two cDNAs coded 
      for the only abundant form of Physarum actin, which is 96% homologous to human 
      gamma-cytoplasmic actin. The ardA2-17 gene also codes for this same actin protein 
      (Nader et al., Gene 48, 133-144, 1986). The coding regions of ardB and ardC differ 
      by 15 nucleotides. A comparison of the ardB and ardC sequences with ardA2-17 showed 
      73 and 77 nucleotide substitutions, respectively, in the coding regions. The 
      noncoding regions of these three sequences were not homologous to each other or to 
      the noncoding regions of actin genes from other organisms. Southern genomic 
      hybridizations indicated that the ardA2-7 and ardD genes have weak sequence 
      similarities to the three isocoding actin genes and thus form a different subclass 
      of the family. Northern hybridizations showed that the ardB and ardC transcripts 
      varied in abundance but were present in all the developmental stages. No ardA2-17 
      transcripts were seen. The relative abundance of the ardB and ardC transcripts was 
      measured in amoebae and plasmodia by S1 nuclease protection and dot hybridization 
      assays. A ratio of approximately 3:1 for ardC versus ardB was found for both stages. 
      P. polycephalum is the first organism shown to contain three unlinked isocoding 
      actin genes, of which at least two are expressed.

PG  - 9143-52
AB  - We have determined the telomeric DNA sequence of the acellular slime molds Didymium 
      iridis and Physarum polycephalum. In both organisms the telomeres consist of tandem 
      repeats of the hexamer 5'(TTAGGG)3'. This sequence was determined by cloning and 
      sequencing the telomeric fragment of the linear extrachromosomal ribosomal DNA from 
      Didymium, as well as direct end labeling and sequencing the rDNA from both 
      organisms. Interestingly, this sequence is identical to the telomeric DNA sequence 
      of the flagellated protozoan Trypanosoma brucei, and suggests that despite the 
      diversity of telomeric sequences previously determined in lower eukaryotes, the 
      necessity to create functional telomeres has led to constraints on these sequences.

TI  - Collective behaviour and swarm intelligence in slime moulds.
PG  - 798-806
LID - 10.1093/femsre/fuw033 [doi]
AB  - The study of collective behaviour aims to understand how individual-level behaviours 
      can lead to complex group-level patterns. Collective behaviour has primarily been 
      studied in animal groups such as colonies of insects, flocks of birds and schools of 
      fish. Although less studied, collective behaviour also occurs in microorganisms. 
      Here, we argue that slime moulds are powerful model systems for solving several 
      outstanding questions in collective behaviour. In particular, slime mould may hold 
      the key to linking individual-level mechanisms to colony-level behaviours. Using 
      well-established principles of collective animal behaviour as a framework, we 
      discuss the extent to which slime mould collectives are comparable to animal groups, 
      and we highlight some potentially fruitful areas for future research.

LID - 10.1007/BF00388203 [doi]
AB  - Repair of thermal injury of Physarum polycephalum Schw. plasmodia has been studied 
      by light and electron microscopy. As a result of heating the plasmodia for 10 min at 
      42°C both the unordered and shuttle protoplasmic streaming were arrested; the outer 
      plasmodial membrane showed alterations at sites of contact with water; the onset of 
      the next mitosis was considerably delayed. The plasmodial ultrastructure was 
      markedly disturbed, including disappearance of the granular component of the 
      nucleoili and a compact, almost fibrillar structure of the latter. The mitochondria 
      became distorted and their intracristal spaces enlarged while the outer and inner 
      membranes appeared in some places to be separated. Glycogen particles disappeared 
      from the cytoplasm. Recovery of both types of protoplasmic streaming of the motility 
      of the plasmodium, of the resistance of its membrane to contact with water, and of 
      the ability of the organism to go through the cell cycle went all hand in hand with 
      the normalization of the structure of nucleoli, mitochondria and cytoplasm. All of 
      the functional and structural characteristics are normalized within ca. 9 h 
      following heating.

TI  - Ionic currents traverse the slime mould physarum.
PG  - 375-9
AB  - Self generated electric currents were studied in protoplasmic drops and small 
      plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum with the aid of an extracellularly measuring 
      vibrating electrode. Ionic currents up to 15 microamperemetercm-2 density were found 
      to traverse the objects. In protoplasmic drops current always enters the numerous 
      protrusions and leaves areas with a smooth surface. In monopodial plasmodia current 
      enters the strand and leaves both the advancing front and the retracting end. This 
      result points toward large changes in membrane arrangement or properties occurring 
      during development of plasmodia from protoplasmic drops.

AB  - Taking advantage of the natural synchrony of the S-phase within the plasmodium of 
      Physarum polycephalum, we extracted highly synchronous DNA samples at precise time 
      points in early S-phase. We then separated, by electrophoresis under denaturating 
      conditions, the newly synthesized DNA strands of the nascent chromosomal replicons 
      from the parental DNA template. Using the cDNA clone of the early-replicating LAV1-2 
      gene as a probe, we could establish by filter hybridization that the elongation rate 
      of the replicon which encompasses this gene is constant, at a rate of 1 kb/min 
      during the first 30 min of S-phase. The smallest replication intermediate (RI) that 
      we have detected by probing with the LAV1-2 cDNA was 5 kb long, suggesting that the 
      LAV1-2 gene and its origin of replication are closely associated within the 
      chromosome. This procedure should facilitate the mapping of replication origins 
      within the genome of Physarum.

TI  - Histone acetylation in replication and transcription: turnover at specific 
      acetylation sites in histone H4 from Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 665-73
AB  - Histone H4 from growing cells is partially acetylated at lysines 5, 8, 12, and 16. 
      The turnover rate at each of these sites was investigated by pulse-labeling 
      plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum with [3H]acetate for 55 min in either S phase or 
      G2 phase of the cell cycle. Labeled histone H4 was purified and digested with a 
      protease which cleaves on the carboxyl side of arginine residues. The peptide 
      containing the acetylation sites was purified by high-performance liquid 
      chromatography. Subfractions of the peptide were obtained due to differences in 
      acetyllysine content. Each subfraction was subjected to automated Edman degradation 
      and the radioactivity released after each cycle was determined. Histone H4 was 
      acetylated uniformly in vitro and acetylated peptide 1-23 was used as a control. The 
      results show a very striking preference for turnover on lysine-5 in the "low acetyl" 
      subfraction from cells in S phase; the "high acetyl" subfraction showed turnover at 
      all four sites. The peptides labeled in G2 phase showed turnover mainly at positions 
      -8, -12, and -16. The data imply that the patterns of histone acetyl turnover 
      associated with replication and transcription are nonrandom and distinct. The 
      results have implications for nucleosome structure particularly the possible role of 
      lysine-5 in chromosome maturation and for the design of experiments to test 
      chromatin function in vitro.

TI  - Insertional editing of mitochondrial tRNAs of Physarum polycephalum and Didymium 
      nigripes.
PG  - 7521-7
AB  - tRNAs encoded on the mitochondrial DNA of Physarum polycephalum and Didymium 
      nigripes require insertional editing for their maturation. Editing consists of the 
      specific insertion of a single cytidine or uridine relative to the mitochondrial DNA 
      sequence encoding the tRNA. Editing sites are at 14 different locations in nine 
      tRNAs. Cytidine insertion sites can be located in any of the four stems of the tRNA 
      cloverleaf and usually create a G. C base pair. Uridine insertions have been 
      identified in the T loop of tRNALys from Didymium and tRNAGlu from Physarum. In both 
      tRNAs, the insertion creates the GUUC sequence, which is converted to GTPsiC (Psi = 
      pseudouridine) in most tRNAs. This type of tRNA editing is different from other, 
      previously described types of tRNA editing and resembles the mRNA and rRNA editing 
      in Physarum and Didymium. Analogous tRNAs in Physarum and Didymium have editing 
      sites at different locations, indicating that editing sites have been lost, gained, 
      or both since the divergence of Physarum and Didymium. Although cDNAs derived from 
      single tRNAs are generally fully edited, cDNAs derived from unprocessed 
      polycistronic tRNA precursors often lack some of the editing site insertions. This 
      enrichment of partially edited sequences in unprocessed tRNAs may indicate that 
      editing is required for tRNA processing or at least that RNA editing occurs as an 
      early event in tRNA synthesis.

TI  - Purification of myxamoebal fragmin, and switching of myxamoebal fragmin to 
      plasmodial fragmin during differentiation of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 233-40
AB  - We have isolated and purified an activity from amoebae of Physarum polycephalum that 
      reduces the flow birefringence of a solution of F-actin in a Ca2+-dependent manner. 
      The purified activity from 100 g of amoebae consisted of 1 mg of a 40,000 mol. wt 
      protein. DNase I-affinity chromatography demonstrated that the protein binds to 
      Physarum actin in a Ca2+-dependent manner, and the binding is not reversed by excess 
      EGTA. Viscometric measurement indicated that the protein (i) accelerates 
      polymerization of G-actin, and (ii) severs F-actin, in a Ca2+-dependent manner. 
      Thus, the protein appeared functionally similar to the fragmin previously isolated 
      from Physarum plasmodia (plasmodial fragmin). However, the two proteins had slightly 
      different mobilities on urea-SDS-PAGE, and antibodies raised against the two 
      proteins scarcely cross-reacted with each other. Hence, we conclude that the two 
      proteins are closely related to but are different from each other, and we have named 
      the novel protein 'myxamoebal fragmin'. Immunoblot analysis indicated that 
      myxamoebal and plasmodial fragmins are specifically present in amoebae and 
      plasmodia, respectively. Results of immunofluorescence staining suggest that the 
      synthesis of plasmodial fragmin is switched on coordinately with the synthesis of 
      the heavy chain of plasmodial myosin and other plasmodium-specific contractile 
      proteins during the apogamic differentiation of amoebae to plasmodia.

TI  - In vivo levels of diadenosine tetraphosphate and adenosine tetraphospho-guanosine in 
      Physarum polycephalum during the cell cycle and oxidative stress.
PG  - 1179-86
AB  - Cellular levels of diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap4A) and adenosine 
      tetraphospho-guanosine (Ap4G) were specifically measured during the cell cycle of 
      Physarum polycephalum by a high-pressure liquid chromatographic method. Ap4A was 
      also measured indirectly by a coupled phosphodiesterase-luciferase assay. No cell 
      cycle-specific changes in either Ap4A or Ap4G were detected in experiments involving 
      different methods of assay, different strains of P. polycephalum, or different 
      methods of fixation of macroplasmodia. Our results on Ap4A are in contrast with 
      those reported previously (C. Weinmann-Dorsch, G. Pierron, R. Wick, H. Sauer, and F. 
      Grummt, Exp. Cell Res. 155:171-177, 1984). Weinmann-Dorsch et al. reported an 8- to 
      30-fold increase in Ap4A in early S phase in P. polycephalum, as measured by the 
      phosphodiesterase-luciferase assay. We also measured levels of Ap4A, Ap4G, and ATP 
      in macroplasmodia treated with 0.1 mM dinitrophenol. Ap4A and Ap4G transiently 
      increased three- to sevenfold after 1 h and then decreased concomitantly with an 80% 
      decrease in the level of ATP after 2 h in the presence of dinitrophenol. These 
      results do not support the hypothesis that Ap4A is a positive pleiotypic activator 
      that modulates DNA replication, but they are consistent with the hypothesis proposed 
      for procaryotes that Ap4A and Ap4G are signal nucleotides or alarmones of oxidative 
      stress (B.R. Bochner, P.C. Lee, S.W. Wilson, C.W. Cutler, and B.N. Ames, Cell 
      37:225-232, 1984).

TI  - Developmentally regulated late mRNAs in the encystment of Physarum polycephalum 
      plasmodia.
PG  - 264-9
AB  - Physarum polycephalum plasmodia survive adverse conditions by transforming into 
      encysted cells called spherules. In this work we analysed the developmentally 
      regulated mRNAs from the late stages of spherulation. A cDNA library was constructed 
      and four abundant mRNAs were identified. One of the mRNAs was present in trace 
      amounts in early spherules, while the other three were found only in late spherules. 
      A cDNA clone for one of the late spherulation specific mRNAs was sequenced. It codes 
      for a 332-amino-acid protein that did not show significant similarities with any 
      known protein. Since the mRNA for this protein accumulates during spherulation, the 
      protein was called spherulin 4. This protein has many features of a plasma membrane 
      protein; it contains a signal peptide and a long hydrophobic region, which could 
      serve as a transmembrane anchor. Another interesting feature is the presence of 
      seven consecutive glycine residues in the N-terminal region. This is even more 
      remarkable since the protein is not rich in glycine.

TI  - Processing in the external transcribed spacer of ribosomal RNA from Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 3153-66
AB  - The rDNA of the myxomycete Physarum polycephalum is transcribed to give a 13.3 kb 
      precursor of ribosomal RNA. At 1.7 kb downstream of the primary initiation site 
      there is a processing site or a second initiation site. This site was studied by 
      S1-mapping, DNA sequencing and electron microscopy. None of these methods could 
      conclusively distinguish between the two formal possibilities. However, capping 
      experiments indicate that rapid processing is taking place at this site rather than 
      reinitiation. In addition, primary transcripts and processed molecules were assayed 
      throughout the synchronous mitotic cycle. During all interphase stages newly 
      initiated transcripts of rDNA and products of the first processing step are present 
      in similar amounts, indicating control of initiation and not of maturation as being 
      the main regulatory step for the accumulation of mature rRNAs. During the brief 
      period of mitosis the level of newly initiated rRNA precursors is lowered.

TI  - Intranuclear localization of histone acetylation in Physarum polycephalum and the 
      structure of functionally active chromatin.
PG  - 265-79
AB  - Based on studies of histone acetylation in vivo in Physarum polycephalum, we present 
      the following hypotheses: (1) Transcription-specific histone acetylation on histones 
      H3 and H4 is a localized process at the nuclear matrix; (2) Histone acetylation in 
      the S phase, which is specific for newly synthesized histones, occurs in an 
      intranuclear nonlocalized process. These hypotheses can explain: (1) the histone 
      specificity of histone acetylation that is dependent on the functional state of the 
      chromatin; (2) the apparent absence of turnover of histone acetylation in the bulk 
      of the chromatin despite a definite low level of steady-state acetylation of all 
      four core histones in bulk chromatin; (3) the pattern of butyrate-induced 
      hyperacetylation observed for active and inactive chromatin.

TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the ribosomal RNA gene of Physarum polycephalum: intron 2 and 
      its flanking regions of the 26S rRNA gene.
PG  - 5507-20
AB  - The 26S ribosomal RNA gene of Physarum polycephalum is interrupted by two introns, 
      and we have previously determined the sequence of one of them (intron 1) (Nomiyama 
      et al. Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.USA 78, 1376-1380, 1981). In this study we sequenced the 
      second intron (intron 2) of about 0.5 kb length and its flanking regions, and found 
      that one nucleotide at each junction is identical in intron 1 and intron 2, though 
      the junction regions share no other sequence homology. Comparison of the flanking 
      exon sequences to E. coli 23S rRNA sequences shows that conserved sequences are 
      interspersed with tracts having little homology. In particular, the region 
      encompassing the intron 2 interruption site is highly conserved. The E. coli 
      ribosomal protein L1 binding region is also conserved.

TI  - Properties of antinuclear antibodies that cross-react with plasma membranes.
PG  - 325-32
AB  - Certain human antinuclear antibodies (ANA) cross-react specifically with the surface 
      membrane of human leucocytes. In the present work these cross-reacting (X) ANA could 
      be eluted directly from viable leucocytes isolated from three patients. The plasma 
      membrane antigen recognized by X-ANA appeared phylogenetically highly conserved 
      since it was present on viable HeLa cells and cells from mouse and rabbit spleen, 
      rat liver, and the slime mould Physarum polycephalum. X-ANA did not react with the 
      plasma membrane of nucleated bird erythrocytes or human erythrocytes or 
      thrombocytes. The same X-ANA subset reacted with the various cells. The presence of 
      X-ANA correlated strongly (P less than 0.01) with antibodies against a HeLa cell 
      surface antigen. The nuclear antigen recognized by X-ANA was present in all species 
      examined, including bird erythrocyte nuclei and nuclei of Physarum polycephalum. 
      Native or denatured DNA, RNA or a saline extract of nuclei did not inhibit the 
      binding of X-ANA to cell nuclei.

TI  - A library of trimethylguanosine-capped small RNAs in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 93-103
AB  - We have constructed a cDNA library for the trimethylguanosine-capped small RNAs 
      (sRNAs) in the acellular slime mold Physarum polycephalum. Capped sRNAs were 
      purified from total cellular RNA of vegetative microplasmodia by preparative 
      immunoprecipitation with anti-trimethylguanosine antibody. The purified RNA was 
      analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Approx. eleven different capped 
      sRNAs were observed with a size range of 70-204 nucleotides (nt). Based on their 
      approximate sizes, the presence of trimethylguanosine cap, and the presence of a 
      lupus type-Sm antigen, molecules U1-U7 (excluding U3) were identified. Further 
      confirmation of the identity of molecule U1a was established by Northern 
      hybridization, U4a by colony hybridization, and U6 and U7a by direct chemical 
      sequence analysis. Purified capped sRNAs were tailed with oligo(A), and inserted 
      into oligo(dT)-tailed plasmid pCDV1. The cDNAs were used to transform Escherichia 
      coli strain HB101. Approx. 1.9 X 10(5) ampicillin-resistant (ApR) transformants were 
      obtained per microgram of tailed sRNA. Dot-blot hybridization, using Physarum RNA 
      precipitated with anti-cap antibody as a probe, indicated that approx. 94% of the 
      ApR colonies contained recombinant DNAs. The library was screened by colony 
      hybridization using heterologous sRNA probes. Clones hybridizing with heterologous 
      sRNAs U1, U2, U4 and U7 were each represented in the library in approximately the 
      same frequency as their relative abundance in the Physarum sRNA population they were 
      derived from. The insert of one Physarum U4 clone was sequenced and was found to 
      have 57.1% homology with nt 1-91 of the published sequence for rat U4 RNA. A 12-nt 
      'functional' subdomain of the rat U4 molecule was 83.3% conserved in Physarum U4.

      Physarum polycephalum using synchronous plasmodial extracts.
PG  - 8343-62
AB  - A cell-free system using synchronous plasmodial extracts initiates replication 
      selectively on the 60 kb rDNA palindrome of Physarum polycephalum. Preferential 
      labeling of rDNA fragments by nuclear extracts, in which elongation is limited, 
      indicates that initiation occurs at two positions corresponding to in vivo origins 
      of replication estimated by electron microscopy. Both nuclear and whole plasmodial 
      extracts initiate selectively within a plasmid, pPHR21, containing one of these 
      origins. In this plasmid bubbles expand bidirectionally and generate DpnI-resistant 
      DNA. Extracts made at prophase or early S phase, times when the nucleolus is 
      disorganized, are most active in pPHR21 replication. Mapping positions of 
      replication bubbles locates the initiation point in a 3.2 kb BstEII fragment at the 
      upstream border of a series of 31 bp repeats 2.4 kb from the initiation point for 
      ribosomal gene transcription.

AB  - A subcloned portion of the 5' nontranslated sequence from a Physarum alpha-tubulin 
      cDNA is specific for a single alpha-tubulin locus, altB, of Physarum polycephalum. 
      We find that this locus is expressed only in the plasmodium and encodes at least an 
      alpha 1-tubulin isotype, which we have designated alpha 1B. Hybridization patterns 
      of other subclones of this cDNA reveal two sequences for alpha-tubulin at the altB 
      locus.

TI  - Gene families encode the major encystment-specific proteins of Physarum polycephalum 
      plasmodia.
PG  - 265-77
AB  - The encystment of Physarum polycephalum plasmodia, also called spherulation, 
      involves the synthesis of many specific mRNAs and proteins. Most of these molecules 
      accumulate at the onset of the major morphological and physiological changes typical 
      of this differentiation pathway and are not present during the other two transitions 
      leading to dormancy in Physarum, namely sporulation and encystment of amoebae. The 
      nucleotide sequences of apparently full-length cDNA copies of the four major 
      encystment-specific mRNAs were determined. The four sequences included the entire 
      coding regions and at least 26 nucleotides of the 5'-nontranscribed leaders. The 
      encoded proteins were named spherulins. We found that spherulins 1a and 1b are 81% 
      homologous and are thus members of a gene family. They both possess putative signal 
      peptides and N-glycosylation sites, suggesting that they are cell-wall 
      glycoproteins. Spherulin 2a and spherulin 3a are non-homologous proteins. The 
      absence of signal peptides suggests that they are intracellular structural proteins. 
      Low-stringency Southern hybridizations showed that each also belongs to a two-member 
      gene family.

TI  - Inheritance of extrachromosomal rDNA in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 635-42
AB  - In the acellular slime mold Physarum polycephalum, the several hundred genes coding 
      for rRNA are located on linear extrachromosomal DNA molecules of a discrete size, 60 
      kilobases. Each molecule contains two genes that are arranged in a palindromic 
      fashion and separated by a central spacer region. We investigated how rDNA is 
      inherited after meiosis. Two Physarum amoebal strains, each with an rDNA 
      recognizable by its restriction endonuclease cleavage pattern, were mated, the 
      resulting diploid plasmodium was induced to sporulate, and haploid progeny clones 
      were isolated from the germinated spores. The type of rDNA in each was analyzed by 
      blotting hybridization, with cloned rDNA sequences used as probes. This analysis 
      showed that rDNA was inherited in an all-or-nothing fashion; that is, progeny clones 
      contained one or the other parental rDNA type, but not both. However, the rDNA did 
      not segregate in a simple Mendelian way; one rDNA type was inherited more frequently 
      than the other. The same rDNA type was also in excess in the diploid plasmodium 
      before meiosis, and the relative proportions of the two rDNAs changed after 
      continued plasmodial growth. The proportion of the two rDNA types in the population 
      of progeny clones reflected the proportion in the parent plasmodium before meoisis. 
      The rDNAs in many of the progeny clones contained specific deletions of some of the 
      inverted repeat sequences at the central palindromic symmetry axis. To explain the 
      pattern of inheritance of Physarum rDNA, we postulate that a single copy of rDNA is 
      inserted into each spore or is selectively replicated after meiosis.

TI  - Partial purification and characterization of a protein lysine methyltransferase from 
      plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 5365-71
AB  - Plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum have an active protein lysine methyltransferase 
      (S-adenosylmethionine:protein-lysine methyltransferase, EC 2.1.1.43). This enzyme 
      has been purified 40-fold with a 13% yield, and it catalyzes the transfer of methyl 
      groups from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to the epsilon-amino group of lysine residues 
      with formation of N epsilon-mono-, N epsilon-di-, and N epsilon-trimethyllysines in 
      a molar ratio of 4:1:1 based on [14C]methyl incorporation into the methylated 
      lysines. The ratio remains unchanged at all stages of the partial purification, as 
      well as after fractionation by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and gel 
      electrophoresis. The rate of protein methylation is time dependent, enzyme 
      concentration dependent, and requires the presence of a sulfhydryl reducing agent 
      for optimal activity. The enzyme has optimal activity at pH 8 and is inhibited by 
      S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine and EDTA. Lysine-rich and arginine-rich histones serve as 
      the most effective exogenous protein acceptors; P. polycephalum actomyosin is 
      inactive, and chick skeletal myofibrillar proteins are 25% as effective as exogenous 
      mixed histones as substrates. Lysine, polylysine, ribonuclease A, cytochrome c, and 
      bovine serum albumin are not methylated.

TI  - Isolation, identification, and characterization of histones from plasmodia of the 
      true slime mold Physarum polycephalum using extraction with guanidine hydrochloride.
PG  - 38-51
AB  - Histones from plasmodia of the true slime mold Physarum polycephalum have been 
      prepared free of slime by an approach to histone isolation that uses extraction of 
      nuclei with 40% guanidine hydrochloride and chromatography of the extract on Bio-Rex 
      70. This procedure followed by chromatography or electrophoresis has been used to 
      obtain pure fractions of histones from Physarum microplasmodia. Physarum 
      microplasmodia have five major histone fractions, and we show by amino acid 
      analysis, apparent molecular weight on three gel systems containing sodium dodecyl 
      sulfate, mobility on gels containing Triton X-100, and other characterizations that 
      these fractions are analogous to mammalian histones H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. 
      Significant differences between Physarum and mammalian histones are noted, with 
      histone H1 showing by far the greatest variation. Histones H1 and H4 from Physarum 
      microplasmodia have similar, but not identical, products of partial chymotryptic 
      digestion compared with those of calf thymus histones H1 and H4. Labeling 
      experiments, in vivo, showed that histone H1 is the major phosphorylated histone and 
      approximately 15 separate phosphopeptides are present in a tryptic digest of 
      Physarum histone H1. The core histones from Physarum, histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, 
      are rapidly acetylated; histone H4 shows five subfractions, analogous to the five 
      subfractions of mammalian histone H4 (containing zero to four acetyllysine residues 
      per molecule); histone H3 has a more complex pattern that we interpret as zero to 
      four acetyllysine residues on each of two sequence variants of histone H3; histones 
      H2A and H2B show less heterogeneity. Overall, the data show that Physarum 
      microplasmodia have a set of histones that is closely analogous to mammalian 
      histones.

      Purification, physico-chemical and kinetic properties.
PG  - 345-55
AB  - Glycogen phosphorylase from macroplasmodia of Physarum polycephalum was purified 
      76-fold to homogeneity. The native enzyme migrated as a single protein band on 
      analytical disc gel electrophoresis coinciding with phosphorylase activity. After 
      reduction in the presence of sodium dodecylsulfate one protein band was detectable 
      which corresponded to an Mr of 93 000. The molecular weight of the native enzyme 
      determined by gel sieving or gradient-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was 172000 
      and 186000, respectively. The enzyme contained about 1 mol pyridoxal 5'-phosphate 
      and less than 0.1 mol covalently bound phosphate per mol subunit. The amino acid 
      composition of the enzyme was determined. In the direction of phosphorolysis the 
      kinetic data were determined by initial velocity studies, assuming a rapid 
      equilibrium random mechanism. Glucose 1-phosphate and GDP-glucose were competitive 
      inhibitors toward phosphate and noncompetitive to glycogen. 5'-AMP, a weak activator

      forms has yet been found.

TI  - Translational regulation of polysome formation during dormancy of Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 490-7
AB  - The translational activity of actively growing microplasmodia and dormant 
      microsclerotia of Physarum polycephalum was investigated by analyzing the 
      distribution of ribosomes in polysomes. Microplasmodial post-mitochondrial fractions 
      contained substantial amounts of polysomes and ribosomal subunits but very few 
      native monosomes. During the starvation period which preceded microsclerotium 
      formation, polysome levels remained constant, whereas the subunit titer began to 
      increase. During encystment ribosomal subunits continued to accumulate as the level 
      of polysomes gradually decreased. Dormant microsclerotia contained a large surplus 
      of stored ribosomal subunits but no detectable polysomes. However, incubation of 
      microsclerotia with concentrations of cycloheximide sufficient to slow polypeptide 
      elongation without affecting initiation caused the gradual reappearance of polysomes 
      at the expense of the subunits. Under these conditions the percentage of subunits 
      driven into polysomes reached values similar to those of actively growing 
      microplasmodia. Microsclerotia returned to nutrient medium contained very low levels 
      of polysomes during the lag period which preceded germination. These were formed 
      with preexisting, stored messenger ribonucleic acid. During the germination period, 
      polysome levels were markedly increased. This elevation was dependent on new 
      ribonucleic acid transcription. It is concluded that dormant microsclerotia contain 
      functional messenger ribonucleic acid and ribosomes which are subject to 
      translational repression at the level of initiation.

TI  - Biosynthesis and posttranslational acetylation of histones during spherulation of 
      Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 3745-62
AB  - Plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum can be induced to differentiate into dormant 
      spherules: DNA-, RNA- and protein-synthesis cease during this process. Analysis of 
      the histone H4 acetylation during spherulation revealed no significant changes of 
      the relative acetate content and percentage of acetylated H4 subspecies. This result 
      does not support a close correlation of histone acetylation and transcriptional 
      activity. Posttranslational incorporation of 3H-acetate into core histones decreased 
      rapidly after start of spherulation. However, acetate incorporation increased 
      significantly at a late stage of spherulation (30 h). To elucidate the role of this 
      elevated acetate incorporation we followed histone synthesis during spherulation. 
      Histone synthesis decreased upon induction of differentiation and stopped after 12 
      h. After 38 h of spherulation histone synthesis again occurred in the absence of DNA 
      synthesis. The peak of acetate incorporation into core histones clearly preceded 
      this late histone synthesis, indicating acetylation of preexisting histones. We 
      suggest, that this acetate incorporation is part of the mechanism, by which 
      preexisting histones are replaced by newly synthesized histones. Pulse treatment 
      with actinomycin D or cycloheximide during spherulation suggested, that the observed 
      histone synthesis is essential for the germination of spherules. Obviously, new 
      histones have to be synthesized for the coordinate course of the differentiation 
      program.

TI  - Induction of polyploid nuclei in Physarum polycephalum by cycloheximide treatment in

PG  - 570-3
AB  - Macroplasmodia of the acellular slime mold Physarum polycephalum were treated with 
      pulses of cycloheximide (10 micrograms/ml medium, for 3 h), initiated 10-20 min 
      before metaphase in the synchronous nuclear division cycle. This treatment 
      interfered with normal division of the nuclei, but permitted DNA synthesis in the 
      next S phase. This interpretation is supported by measurements of the DNA content 
      per nucleus in cycloheximide-treated cultures as compared to control cultures, which 
      show that some nuclei after cycloheximide treatment are polyploid. By this method we 
      can produce polyploid strains of Physarum, but the elevated nuclear DNA content is 
      not stable, and after several months the strains have reverted to the normal diploid 
      DNA content.

TI  - Mitotic delays and macromolecular synthesis in G2 phase-irradiated plasmodia of 
      Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 104-11
AB  - Mitotically synchronous surface plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum were irradiated 
      at different times of G2 phase with doses of UV ranging from 350 to 2800 Jm-2. The 
      UV sensitivity, measured in terms of delay in progression towards mitosis, gradually 
      declined through G2 phase to almost zero in early prophase, when irradiated with 350 
      Jm-2 of UV. However, with higher doses, 700 and 1400 Jm-2, late G2 was found to be 
      even more susceptible than early G2. The delay in these cases rises for the last 0.1 
      part of the cycle up to a UV-transition point in early prophase. Thus, processes 
      which were not sensitive to a lower dose of UV are affected by higher doses. Above 
      700 Jm-2, delay was not directly proportional to dose. With doses above 1400 Jm-2, 
      the delays obtained were more variable, although some tendency for an increased 
      delay is observed in plasmodia irradiated in late G2 when compared with those 
      irradiated in middle G2. The least UV-sensitive phase is between -0.2 and -0.4 part 
      of the cycle in relation to mitosis (0 point). Both RNA synthesis and protein 
      synthesis are inhibited in plasmodia irradiated at any time during G2 phase with 
      1400 Jm-2 of UV. However, on an average, irradiation in late G2 caused the most 
      inhibitions.

TI  - Uptake of calcium ions into microsomes isolated from Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 207-13
AB  - Membranous vesicles (microsomes) were isolated from plasmodia of the acellular slime 
      mold, Physarum polycephalum. The microsomes were about 0.2 about 0.2 micronM in 
      diameter, and about 10 nm thick. The main protein component of the vesicles had a 
      molecular weight of 100,000 daltons. Calcium ions were taken up by the microsomes 
      only in the presence of Mg2+- ATP. The maximum amount of Ca2+ ions accumulated in 
      the microsomes was 0.24 micronmole/mg protein. The Ca2+ uptake was not accelerated 
      by oxalate. The ATPase [EC 3.6.1.3] activity required Ca2+ ions for full activation. 
      The concentration of Ca2+ ions required for half-maximum activation was about 1 
      micronM. The Km and Vm values were 53 micronM and 1.6 micronmole/(mg-min), 
      respectively. About 0.2 mole of Ca2+ ions was taken up by the microsomes, coupled 
      with the hydrolysis of 1 mole of ATP. THE ATPase activity and Ca2+ uptake of the 
      microsomes were not inhibited by sodium azide. Furthermore, electron microscopic 
      examination showed that mitochondrial contamination was slight. These results 
      suggest that a vesicular calcium transport system, analogous to the sacroplasmic 
      reticulum in skeletal muscle, is involved in regulation of the Ca2+ concentration in 
      plasmodia of Physarum.

TI  - Histone H4 mRNA is stored as a small cytoplasmic RNP during the G2 phase in Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 162-71
AB  - In Physarum polycephalum the triggering of histone H4 gene transcription occurs in 
      G2 phase. The rate of synthesis of histone H4 mRNA was measured by in vivo 
      pulse-labeling experiments. We show that it begins to increase in mid-G2. During the 
      second part of G2 it increases approximately 20 fold over its minimum value and 
      reaches a maximum at the end of G2. After entry of the cells in S, histone H4 gene 
      transcription rate begins to decrease and reaches a minimum value in early G2. The 
      histone H4 mRNA which accumulates in G2 is not translated immediately into proteins 
      but is stored in an inactive form until the beginning of the next S phase. 
      Immediately after its transcription the H4 mRNA is transported to the cytoplasm 
      where it is stored and stabilized as an inactive mRNP complex. This was shown by 
      fractionation of cytoplasmic RNP in sucrose gradients and blot hybridization of 
      subcellular fractions.

TI  - Cell cycle changes in Physarum polycephalum histone H1 phosphate: relationship to 
      deoxyribonucleic acid binding and chromosome condensation.
PG  - 2240-6
AB  - We have examined the relationship of phosphate content in histone H1 of Physarum 
      polycephalum to mitotic chromosome condensation and affinity for deoxyribonucleic 
      acid (DNA). H1 undergoes a series of posttranslational phosphorylations which 
      increase its apparent molecular weight on NaDodSO4-polyacrylamide gels. Our studies 
      confirm the observation by Bradbury and co-workers [Bradbury, E. M., Inglis, R. J., 
      Matthews, H. R., & Sarner, N (1973) Eur. J. Biochem. 33, 131-139; Bradbury, E. M., 
      Inglis, R. J., & Matthews, H. R. (1974) Nature (London) 247, 257-261] that the 
      accumulation of phosphate in H1 increases markedly shortly before the onset of 
      mitosis. However, we show in pulse-chase experiments with both 32PO4H1 and 
      [14C]lysine H1 that there is no significant dephosphorylation of the histone either 
      during or shortly after mitosis, suggesting that nonspecific postmitotic 
      dephosphorylation of H1 is not a prerequisite for chromosome decondensation. We also 
      show that both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of H1 bind with somewhat 
      greater affinity to single-stranded DNA-cellulose than to native DNA-cellulose and 
      that phosphorylation weakens the affinity of H1 to both forms of DNA-cellulose.

PG  - 739-51
AB  - Time-lapse cinematography and immunofluorescence microscopy were used to study 
      cellular events during amoebal fusions and sexual plasmodium development in Physarum 
      polycephalum. Amoebal fusions occurred frequently in mixtures of strains 
      heteroallelic or homoallelic for the mating-type locus matA, but plasmodia developed 
      only in the matA-heteroallelic cultures. These observations confirmed that matA 
      controls development of fusion cells rather than cell fusion. Analysis of cell 
      pedigrees showed that, in both types of culture, amoebae fused at any stage of the 
      cell cycle except mitosis. In matA-heteroallelic fusion cells, nuclear fusion 
      occurred in interphase about 2 h after cell fusion; interphase nuclear fusion did 
      not occur in matA-homoallelic fusion cells. The diploid zygote, formed by nuclear 
      fusion in matA-heteroallelic fusion cells, entered an extended period of cell growth 
      which ended in the formation of a binucleate plasmodium by mitosis without 
      cytokinesis. In contrast, no extension to the cell cycle was observed in 
      matA-homoallelic fusion cells and mitosis was always accompanied by cytokinesis. In 
      matA-homoallelic cultures, many of the binucleate fusion cells split apart without 
      mitosis, regenerating pairs of uninucleate amoebae; in the remaining fusion cells, 
      the nuclei entered mitosis synchronously and spindle fusion sometimes occurred, 
      giving rise to a variety of products. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that 
      matA-heteroallelic fusion cells possessed two amoebal microtubule organizing 
      centres, and that most zygotes possessed only one; amoebal microtubule organization 
      was lost gradually over several cell cycles. In matA-homoallelic cultures, all the 
      cells retained amoebal microtubule organization.

TI  - F-actin bundling protein from Physarum polycephalum: purification and its capacity 
      for co-bundling of actin filaments and microtubules.
PG  - 244-54
AB  - An F-actin bundling protein was isolated and purified from plasmodium of Physarum 
      polycephalum. The F-actin bundling protein in Physarum extract was passed through a 
      DEAE-cellulose column. After the protein in the fraction was treated with 6 M urea, 
      it was purified by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300 HR followed by chromatography 
      on CM-Toyopearl (cation exchange) in the presence of 6 M urea. The purified protein 
      gave a single band on SDS-PAGE, and the molecular weight was estimated to be 52,000. 
      This F-actin bundling protein is referred to as the 52 kDa protein. Interestingly, 
      the 52 kDa protein also induced bundling of microtubules. The formation of F-actin 
      and microtubule bundles was Ca(2+)-insensitive, but depended on the salt 
      concentration. Each bundle formed at NaCl concentrations less than 0.1 M. The 52 kDa 
      protein cross-reacted with monoclonal antibody raised against a HeLa 55 kDa protein 
      (an F-actin bundling protein from HeLa cells) (Yamashiro-Matsumura and Matsumura: J. 
      Biol. Chem. 260:5087-5097, 1985). When the 52 kDa protein was added to a mixture of 
      actin filaments and microtubules, co-bundles composed of both filaments formed. This 
      is the first reported example in which an F-actin bundling protein induced 
      co-bundling of actin filaments and microtubules.

TI  - Distribution of acetylated alpha-tubulin in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 303-9
AB  - The expression and cytological distribution of acetylated alpha-tubulin was 
      investigated in Physarum polycephalum. A monoclonal antibody specific for acetylated 
      alpha-tubulin, 6-11B-1 (Piperno, G., and M. T. Fuller, 1985, J. Cell Biol., 
      101:2085-2094), was used to screen for this protein during three different stages of 
      the Physarum life cycle--the amoeba, the flagellate, and the plasmodium. Western 
      blots of two-dimensional gels of amoebal and flagellate proteins reveal that this 
      antibody recognizes the alpha 3 tubulin isotype, which was previously shown to be 
      formed by posttranslational modification (Green, L. L., and W. F. Dove, 1984, Mol. 
      Cell. Biol., 4:1706-1711). Double-label immunofluorescence demonstrates that, in the 
      flagellate, acetylated alpha-tubulin is localized in the flagella and flagellar 
      cone. Similar experiments with amoebae interestingly reveal that only within the 
      microtubule organizing center (MTOC) are there detectable amounts of acetylated 
      alpha-tubulin. In contrast, the plasmodial stage gives no evidence for acetylated 
      alpha-tubulin by Western blotting or by immunofluorescence.

TI  - Characterization of a putative fusogen encoded in a mitochondrial plasmid of 
      Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 255-61
AB  - The mitochondrial plasmid mF induces mitochondrial fusion in zygotes and during 
      sporulation in the true slime mold Physarum polycephalum. There are nine open 
      reading frames (ORFs) in the mF plasmid, and it has been suggested that ORF640 
      encodes the mitochondrial fusogen. We prepared antisera directed against the ORF640 
      protein (ORF640p) in rabbits, and used it to localize this protein in mitochondria. 
      Western blot analysis showed that ORF640p was produced only in the mitochondria of 
      mF(+) strains, i.e., in cells that carried the mF plasmid. Proteinase K treatment of 
      mitochondria isolated from the mF(+) strain suggested that the C-terminus 
      coiled-coil (CC) region of ORF640p was exported from the matrix to the cytosol. 
      Digitonin treatment confirmed this localization. West-Western blot analysis 
      suggested that the CC region of ORF640p formed multimers and could interfere with an 
      unknown mitochondrial protein in normal mitochondria. These results suggest that 
      ORF640p is related to fusion of the outer mitochondrial membrane.

TI  - Calcium accumulation in vacuoles of Physarum polycephalum following starvation.
PG  - 75-85
AB  - The plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum contained 15.3 mmol Ca/kg fresh weight of 
      sample, 11.8 mmol Mg/kg, 24.5 mmol K/kg and 1.4 mmol Na/kg. When the plasmodium was 
      starved of food, the Ca content increased gradually up to 71.9 mmol/kg during 5 days 
      of starvation. The concentration of other elements changed only slightly. The 
      endoplasm contained 23.0 mmol Ca/kg, 12.6 mmol Mg/kg, 26.6 mmol K/kg and 1.7 mmol 
      Na/kg, but these contents changed only slightly during starvation. The Ca, Mg, K and 
      Na contents of the slime and the soluble fraction were also determined. In order to 
      clarify where the accumulated Ca was localized, Ca in the plasmodium was 
      precipitated with potassium pyroantimonate and examined by electron microscopy. In 
      the starved plasmodium, the vacuoles which contained the electron-opaque 
      precipitates and were located in the ectoplasm increased in number, compared with 
      the unstarved plasmodium. At the same time the large electron-opaque granules in the 
      extracellular slime increased in number. The electron-opaque precipitates were 
      identified as Ca pyroantimonate by its susceptibility to removal by chelation with 
      ethyleneglycol bis (beta-aminoethyl ether) N, N, N', N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) and 
      X-ray microprobe analysis.

TI  - Selective modification of positive chemotaxis in the true slime mold Physarum

PG  - 89-98
AB  - The plasmodium of the true slime mold Physarum polycephalum was treated with EDTA or 
      EGTA and the effect of the treatment on the chemotactic response was examined by 
      measuring the chemotactic motive force with the double-chamber method. The results 
      obtained were as follows: (1) The treatment of the plasmodium with 5 mM EDTA (pH 
      7.0, 20 min) did not give any significant effect on the protoplasmic streaming or 
      motility. (2) The plasmodium treated with EDTA exhibited no chemotactic response to 
      non-electrolyte attractants (D-glucose, D-galactose, D-mannose, and maltose) and 
      negative chemotaxis to electrolyte attractants (cyclic AMP and NaH2PO4). (3) The 
      EDTA treatment gave no effect on the chemotactic response to repellents (D-fructose, 
      NaCl, CaCl2, MgCl2). (4) The EDTA-treated plasmodium exhibited changes in the 
      membrane potential in response to both attractants and repellents as similar to the 
      untreated plasmodium. (5) The treatment of the plasmodium with 5 mM EGTA (pH 7.0, 20 
      min) gave results similar to those obtained with the EDTA treatment. The results 
      obtained suggested that EDTA (or EGTA) treatment did not affect the receptor sites 
      but modified the transduction mechanism from reception into tactic movement.

TI  - Effect of sugars on salt reception in true slime mold Physarum polycephalum. 
      Physicochemical interpretation of interaction between salt and sugar receptions.
PG  - 369-81
AB  - Interaction between salt and sugar receptions in plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum 
      was studied by using double-chamber method. Effect of sugars on salt reception was 
      evaluated by measuring membrane potential and the motive force of tactic movement of 
      the slime mold, where salt concentration in one compartment was increased 
      successively with a fixed sugar concentration. Results are summarized as follows: 
      (1) The presence of D-glucose, D-mannose, D-maltose, or sucrose in medium led to 
      increase of the threshold concentration Cth, for salts (chlorides and nitrates of 
      Li, Na, K), whereas D-ribose decreased the threshold for salt reception. D-galactose 
      showed no appreciable effect on Cth of every salt species examined. No change in Cth 
      for salt reception was observed until concentration of sugars exceeded their 
      respective thresholds. (2) Double logarithmic plots of Cth for salts against sugar 
      concentration followed different straight lines for different cations, whose slopes 
      being closely correlated with the effects of lyotropic number of anions in the 
      absence of sugars. (3) Plots of log Cth against the reciprocal of the absolute 
      temperature, 1/T, gave linear relations, and the slopes of the straight line became 
      small with increase of sugar concentration above their respective thresholds. 
      Experimental results obtained here suggest that the structure of water at the 
      interface of cell membrane plays an indispensable role in the interaction between 
      salt and sugar receptions.

TI  - The electron-transport system of mitochondria from the slime mould Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 745-51
AB  - A method is described for the preparation of mitochondria from the slime mould 
      Physarum polycephalum; the mitochondria were not coupled. P. polycephalum 
      mitochondria oxidized added NADH via a rotenone-insensitive pathway, but the 
      oxidation of malate plus glutamate was rotenone sensitive; both of these substrates 
      reduced much less cytochrome b than did succinate, in both aerobic and anaerobic 
      steady states. Spectroscopy at 77 degrees K separated three absorption maxima in the 
      alpha-band region, at 560nm, 553nm and one at 547nm due to cytochrome c. The 
      absorption at 553nm was increased in the aerobic steady state by the addition of 
      2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide, suggesting that it was due to a b-type 
      cytochrome. All three absorption maxima appeared in the aerobic steady state after 
      the addition of a range of substrates. The respiratory activity with different 
      substrates and the response to inhibitors of respiration were similar to those 
      previously described for fungus mitochondria (Weiss et al., 1970; Erickson & 
      Ashworth, 1969). When grown under conditions of haem limitation the mitochondria 
      contained a lower concentration of cytochromes than normal.

TI  - Regulation of thymidine kinase synthesis during the cell cycle of Physarum 
      polycephalum: the effects of two microtubule inhibitors.
PG  - 47-62
AB  - Methyl benzimidazole carbamate and griseofulvin are two microtubule inhibitors which 
      perturb plasmodial mitosis in Physarum polycephalum. These two compounds perturb not 
      only the mitotic process leading to abortive mitosis but delay the onset of mitosis. 
      Both drugs delayed the onset of thymidine kinase synthesis (EC 2.7.1.21, ATP: 
      thymidine 5'phosphotransferase) which occurred concomitantly with mitosis. Thus, 
      thymidine kinase synthesis, a cell cycle event which is not thought to have any 
      relationship with the microtubular system, was perturbed in the same way as mitosis 
      in the presence of two chemically unrelated microtubule inhibitors. It is suggested 
      that the microtubular system is an essential part of a regulatory pathway of the 
      cell cycle which plays a role in at least two events of the cell cycle: the onset of 
      thymidine kinase synthesis, and the onset of mitosis.

TI  - Purification and enzymatic characterization of three endoDNase isoenzymes from 
      Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 651-61
AB  - Three alkaline DNases, A, B, and C, with preference for the digestion of 
      double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) were partially purified from microplasmodia of Physarum 
      polycephalum. They were very similar but differed in their isoelectric points. These 
      were pH 5.8 for DNase A, 7.1 for DNase B, and 9.1 for DNase C. All three enzymes 
      consisted of a single polypeptide chain with a molecular weight of 16,000 to 17,000, 
      which readily formed high molecular weight complexes with low enzyme activity. These 
      complexes could be reversibly dissociated by urea, and DNase activity was 
      quantitatively reactivated. The DNases hydrolyzed the substrate DNA by an 
      endonucleolytic mechanism which gave 5'-phosphorylated products. Divalent cations, 
      MnCl2 or MgCl2, were essential for enzyme activity at the optimum pH of 
      approximately 8.5 and at low ionic strength. The optimal conditions of pH, buffer, 
      divalent cations and ionic strength and the extent of inhibition by salt, phosphate 
      ions or urea differed slightly but significantly between the different isoenzymes.

PG  - 309-20
AB  - The DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II or B from the lower eukaryote Physarum 
      polycephalum has been purified to apparent homogeneity by a new method employing 
      poly(ethylene imine) precipitation and elution, and heparin-Sepharose affinity 
      chromatography. The method is readily scaled up or down and affords a purification 
      of over 5000-fold with a yield of 35-45%. The procedure is easy to perform and can 
      be carried out in less than three days even on a large scale. Furthermore, it gives 
      enzyme of higher purity and in at least 10-fold greater yield than previously 
      published procedures for its purification from this organism. These improvements 
      have allowed the detection of a series of subforms of the enzyme. The combination of 
      precipitation using poly(ethylene imine) with chromatography on heparin-Sepharose 
      may prove useful in the preparation of other proteins which interact with nucleic 
      acids.

TI  - The organisation of genes for transfer RNA and ribosomal RNA in amoebae and 
      plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 165-74
AB  - 1. Using hybridisation techniques nuclei from both amoebae and plasmodia of Physarum 
      polycephalum were found to contain 275 genes each coding for 5.8-S, 19-S and 26-S 
      rRNA, 685 genes for 5-S rRNA and 1050 genes for tRNA. 2. Hybridisation of these RNA 
      species to both amoebal and plasmodial DNA fractionated on CsCl gradients reveal 
      that the 5.8-S, 19-S and 26-S rRNA genes are located at a satellite position 
      (formula: see text) with respect to the main band of DNA, whereas 4-S RNA genes are 
      located exclusively in the main band of DNA (formula: see text). 3. This result was 
      confirmed by demonstrating that only the 5.8-S, 19-S and 26-S rRNA species hybridise 
      to purified plasmodial ribosomal DNA. 4. The 19-S and 26-S rRNA genes of amoebae are 
      located on extrachromosomal DNA molecules of a discrete size (Mr = 38 X 10(6)) with 
      identical properties to plasmodial ribosomal DNA.

TI  - Evidence for a homolog of the yeast cell cycle regulatory gene product of cdc2+ in 
      Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 95-103
AB  - Evidence for the presence of a Cdc2-like protein in Physarum polycephalum has been 
      obtained using a peptide antibody directed against a highly conserved amino acid 
      sequence near the N-terminal end of Cdc2, Cdc28 and Cdc2HS. The antibody detected a 
      34 kDa cytoplasmic protein, similar in apparent size to Cdc2 in yeast and Cdc2Hs in 
      HeLa cells. A 60 kDa nuclear band was also detected in Physarum but not in yeast or 
      HeLa. Evidence is presented that this is not related to the 34 kDa protein nor is it 
      found in HeLa nuclei or yeast cells. The Cdc2-like protein level did not fluctuate 
      over more than 10 h of the naturally synchronous cell cycle of Physarum. Several 
      heat-shock experiments using regimens that either: delayed mitosis and S-phase; 
      prevented mitosis or uncoupled S-phase from mitosis were performed. None had any 
      effect on the level of the Cdc2-like protein. The induction of spherulation by 
      starvation was shown to have no effect on the levels of the 34 kDa Cdc2 analog. The 
      invariant level of the 34 kDa protein during the cell cycle and starvation is 
      consistent with previous results obtained with yeast. Three heat-shock regimens 
      which either delay mitosis, eliminate S-phase or uncouple mitosis from S-phase in 
      Physarum also had no effect on the level of the 34 kDa protein. This result 
      emphasizes the stable nature of this protein.

TI  - Superoxide dismutase activity and glutathione concentration during the 
      calcium-induced differentiation of Physarum polycephalum microplasmodia.
PG  - 181-6
AB  - Microplasmodia of Physarum polycephalum differentiate into spherules when the CaCl2 
      concentration of their nutrient medium is increased to 54mM (high-calcium). The 
      salts starvation medium routinely used to induce differentiation contains 8mM CaCl2. 
      This medium will not induce spherulation in the absence of a calcium salt; no other 
      metal is essential. High-calcium also induces the spherulation of a strain of 
      Physarum that had not been previously observed to spherulate. The striking increase 
      in superoxide dismutase activity (SOD) and the decrease in glutathione concentration 
      (GSH) that are characteristic of salts-induced spherulation do not occur in salts 
      media containing high-calcium. In the absence of calcium, no significant change in 
      SOD is observed and very little change in GSH occurs. The immediate effect of the 
      oxidative stress associated with spherulation may be the release of calcium stores 
      into the cytosol. The parameters modulating this stress are, in turn, sensitive to 
      exogenous calcium concentrations.

TI  - Constitutive homologous recombination between mitochondrial DNA and a linear

PG  - 221-7
AB  - In one particular myxamoebal strain (NG7; mF+) of Physarum polycephalum, a linear 
      mitochondrial plasmid (mF plasmid) which promotes mitochondrial fusion has been 
      identified. A mating between mF- strains, that do not carry the mF plasmid, resulted 
      in uniparental inheritance of the mtDNA. In matings between mF+ and mF- strains a 
      recombination occurred between the mtDNA and the mF plasmid, and recombinant mtDNA 
      was generated with the end of the mF plasmid as its ends. The DNA sequences of the 
      recombination site in the mtDNA and the mF plasmid, and of the recombinant mtDNA, 
      revealed that the mF plasmid had a 473-bp sequence that was identical to, but 
      slightly shorter than, a 477-bp sequence of the mtDNA. This so-called identical 
      sequence was found at the junction between unique sequences of the mF plasmid and 
      the mtDNA in the recombinant mtDNA. Thus, the recombination between the mtDNA and 
      the mF plasmid was due to reciprocal crossing-over at the identical sequence.

TI  - Characterization of the thymidine kinase of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 323-30
AB  - Thymidine kinase [ATP: thymidine 5'-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.21] has been 
      purified more than 3,500 fold from microplasmodia of Physarum polycephalum. 
      Properties of the enzyme were determined on preparations purified 1,400 fold. 
      Thymidine was transformed to dTMP while a stoichiometric quantity of ATP was 
      transformed to ADP. 5-Iododeoxyuridine, 5-bromodeoxyuridine, and 
      5-fluorodeoxyuridine acted as competitive inhibitors for the thymidine substrate 
      while 5-bromodeoxyuridine could be used as a substrate. In contrast uridine did not 
      inhibit the enzymatic activity while deoxyuridine was a very poor competitive 
      inhibitor in agreement with the observation that deoxyuridine could not be used as a 
      substrate. Two apparent Michaelis constants were found for thymidine. Only the 
      highest Michaelis constant could be decreased in the presence of increasing 
      concentrations of ATP. Among the various nucleoside mono, di, or triphosphates 
      studied only ATP and to a less extent dATP could be used as phosphate donors. A non 
      competitive inhibition for thymidine was observed with dTTP. dTMP, dTDP, and dTTP 
      acted as competitive inhibitors for ATP. None of the nucleoside mono, di, or 
      triphosphates studied showed an activatory effect at low concentrations of ATP, even 
      in the presence of dTTP. However, dUTP and dGDP acted as competitive inhibitors for 
      ATP.

TI  - An unusual polyanion from Physarum polycephalum that inhibits homologous DNA 
      polymerase alpha in vitro.
PG  - 5219-26
AB  - From extracts of microplasmodia of Physarum polycephalum and their culture medium, 
      an unusual substance was isolated which inhibited homologous DNA polymerase alpha of 
      this slime mold but not beta-like DNA polymerase and not heterologous DNA 
      polymerases. Analysis, especially NMR spectroscopy, revealed the major component to 
      be an anionic polyester of L-malic acid and the inhibition to be due to 
      poly(L-malate) in binding reversibly to DNA polymerase alpha. The mode of inhibition 
      is competitive with substrate DNA and follows an inhibition constant Ki = 10 ng/mL. 
      Inhibition is reversed in the presence of spermine, spermidine, poly(ethylene 
      imine), and calf thymus histone H1. According to its ester nature, the inhibitor is 
      slightly labile at neutral and instable at acid and alkaline conditions. Its largest 
      size corresponds to a molecular mass of 40-50 kDa, but the bulk of the material 
      after purification has lower molecular masses. The inhibitory activity depends on 
      the polymer size and has a minimal size requirement.

TI  - Effects of sinusoidal 60-Hz electric and magnetic fields on ATP and oxygen levels in 
      the slime mold, Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 307-14
AB  - We have previously reported that exposing the vegetative plasmodia stage of Physarum 
      polycephalum to either individual or simultaneously applied electric and magnetic 
      fields (45-75 Hz, 0.14-2.0 G, and 0.035-0.7 V/m) lengthens their mitotic cycle, 
      depresses their rate of reversible shuttle streaming, and lowers their respiration 
      rate. In this article we report the effects of simultaneously applied 
      electromagnetic fields (60 Hz, 1.0 G, 1.0 V/m), electric fields only (60 Hz, 1.0 
      V/m), magnetic fields only (60 Hz, 1.0 G) on the haploid amoeba of Physarum exposed 
      for 120-180 days. Statistically significant depressions (about 8-11%) in ATP levels 
      were observed with all field conditions; however, respiration was significantly 
      decreased only when amoebae were subjected to either combined fields or electric 
      fields alone. Magnetic fields alone failed to induce a significant decrease in 
      respiration.

TI  - Immunocytochemistry of the acellular slime mould Physarum polycephalum. I. 
      Preparation, morphology, and reliability of results concerning cytoplasmic 
      actomyosin patterns in sandwiched plasmodia.
PG  - 13-28
AB  - Small phaneroplasmodia of Physarum polycephalum migrate, under sandwich conditions 
      between two agar sheets and a membrane of cellophane, as thin protoplasmic sheets. 
      This method suitably simulates the situation in the natural habitat of acellular 
      slime moulds; i.e. the narrow clefts of the forest soil. The highly differentiated 
      system of cytoplasmic fibrils displayed under these conditions survives both 
      long-term extraction with glycerol and fixation with methanol, procedures that 
      remove the strong inherent autofluorescence, thus allowing the use of 
      immunocytochemical studies. The complicated fibrillar system of sandwiched plasmodia 
      consists of: (1) a membrane-associated cortical filament layer in the anterior 
      region; (2) a more or less regular polygonal fibrillar network in the intermediate 
      region; and (3) a helically twisted fibrillar system encircling endoplasmic pathways 
      as well as isolated strands in the posterior region. So far, three different 
      cytoskeletal proteins have been identified immunocytochemically as constituents of 
      the fibrillar structures: actin, myosin and AM-protein (fragmin). No positive 
      identification of alpha-actinin, filamin and tropomyosin was obtained using 
      antibodies against vertebrate proteins. Electron microscopy of glycerol-extracted 
      specimens treated with antibodies against actin and myosin revealed that the 6 nm 
      filaments consist of actin, whereas the electron-dense material between single actin 
      filaments appears to be myosin. The AM-protein modulating the polymer status of 
      actin is located in all fibrillar structures.

AB  - RNA editing describes the process in which individual or short stretches of 
      nucleotides in a messenger or structural RNA are inserted, deleted, or substituted. 
      A high level of RNA editing has been observed in the mitochondrial genome of 
      Physarum polycephalum. The most frequent editing type in Physarum is the insertion 
      of individual Cs. RNA editing is extremely accurate in Physarum; however, little is 
      known about its mechanism. Here, we demonstrate how analyzing two organisms from the 
      Myxomycetes, namely Physarum polycephalum and Didymium iridis, allows us to test 
      hypotheses about the editing mechanism that can not be tested from a single organism 
      alone. First, we show that using the recently determined full transcriptome 
      information of Physarum dramatically improves the accuracy of computational editing 
      site prediction in Didymium. We use this approach to predict genes in the 
      mitochondrial genome of Didymium and identify six new edited genes as well as one 
      new gene that appears unedited. Next we investigate sequence conservation in the 
      vicinity of editing sites between the two organisms in order to identify sites that 
      harbor the information for the location of editing sites based on increased 
      conservation. Our results imply that the information contained within only nine or 
      ten nucleotides on either side of the editing site (a distance previously suggested 
      through experiments) is not enough to locate the editing sites. Finally, we show 
      that the codon position bias in C insertional RNA editing of these two organisms is 
      correlated with the selection pressure on the respective genes thereby directly 
      testing an evolutionary theory on the origin of this codon bias. Beyond revealing 
      interesting properties of insertional RNA editing in Myxomycetes, our work suggests 
      possible approaches to be used when finding sequence motifs for any biological 
      process fails.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of myosin from amoebae of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 8022-7
AB  - Myosin was isolated from amoebae of Physarum polycephalum and compared with myosin 
      from plasmodia, another motile stage in the Physarum life cycle. Amoebal myosin 
      contained heavy chains (Mr approximately 220,000), phosphorylatable light chains (Mr 
      18,000), and Ca2+-binding light chains (Mr 14,000) and possessed a two-headed 
      long-tailed shape in electron micrographs after rotary shadow casting. In the 
      presence of high salt concentrations, myosin ATPase activity increased in the 
      following order: Mg-ATPase activity less than K-EDTA-ATPase activity less than 
      Ca-ATPase activity. In the presence of low salt concentrations, Mg-ATPase activity 
      was activated approximately 9-fold by skeletal muscle actin. This actin-activated 
      ATPase activity was inhibited by micromolar levels of Ca2+. Amoebal myosin was 
      indistinguishable from plasmodial myosin in ATPase activities and molecular shape. 
      However, the heavy chain and phosphorylatable light chains of amoebal myosin could 
      be distinguished from those of plasmodial myosin in sodium dodecyl 
      sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, peptide mapping, and immunological 
      studies, suggesting that these are different gene products. Ca2+-binding light 
      chains of amoebal and plasmodial myosins were found to be identical using similar 
      criteria, supporting our hypothesis that the Ca2+-binding light chain plays a key 
      role in the inhibition of actin-activated ATPase activity in Physarum myosins by 
      micromolar levels of Ca2+.

TI  - Polyamine-stimulated alteration of the ornithine decarboxylase molecule in Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 345-51
AB  - The molecular mechanism for polyamine-stimulated feedback modification of ornithine 
      decarboxylase isolated from Physarum polycephalum was investigated by using 
      two-dimensional polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. Partially purified A-form enzyme 
      was converted into the B-form enzyme by isolated fractions of the Physarum 
      A-B-converting protein, and the substrates and products were subsequently labelled 
      by covalent addition of alpha-difluoro[14C]methylornithine, an enzyme-activated 
      irreversible inhibitor. The active (A-form) and inactive (B-form) states of this 
      enzyme were found to have the same Mr value, 52 000, yet they differed noticeably in 
      their pI values, 5.45 and 5.65 respectively. In further experiments, the use of 
      high-specific-radioactivity [3H]spermidine to stimulate this enzyme modification was 
      shown not to result in the covalent attachment of this polyamine to ornithine 
      decarboxylase. These results demonstrate that the polyamine-induced modification of 
      ornithine decarboxylase in Physarum is not due to any of the mechanisms previously 
      suggested for ornithine decarboxylase inactivation in this and other eukaryotes, 
      namely phosphorylation, covalent polyamine addition or the non-covalent association 
      of a specific low-Mr protein.

TI  - A DNA polymerase with unusual properties from the slime mold Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 397-405
AB  - Two forms of a DNA polymerase have been purified from microplasmodia of Physarum 
      polycephalum by poly(ethyleneimine) precipitation and chromatography on 
      DEAE-Sephacel, phosphocellulose, heparin Sepharose, hydroxyapatite, DNA-agarose, 
      blue-Sepharose. They were separated from DNA polymerase alpha on phosphocellulose 
      and from each other on heparin-Sepharose. Form HS1 enzyme was 30-40% pure and form 
      HS2 enzyme 60% with regard to protein contents of the preparations. Form HS2 enzyme 
      was generated from form HS1 enzyme on prolonged standing of enzyme preparations. The 
      DNA polymerases were obtained as complexes of a 60-kDa protein associated with 
      either a 135-kDa (HS1) or a 110-kDa (HS2) DNA-polymerizing polypeptide in a 1:1 
      molar stoichiometry. The biochemical function of the 60-kDa protein remained 
      unknown. The complexes tended to dissociate during gradient centrifugation and 
      during partition chromatography as well as during polyacrylamide gradient gel 
      electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions at high dilutions of samples. Both 
      forms existed in plasmodia extracts, their proportions depending on several factors 
      including those which promoted proteolysis. The DNA polymerases resembled eucaryotic 
      DNA polymerase beta by several criteria and were functionally indistinguishable from 
      each other. It is suggested that lower eucaryotes contain repair DNA polymerases, 
      which are similar to those of eubacteria on a molecular mass basis.

TI  - Translational control and the cytoskeleton in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 129-37
AB  - Translationally active plasmodia of the syncytial slime mold Physarum polycephalum 
      develop into translationally dormant sclerotia during starvation. Although 
      functional mRNA and ribosomes exist in sclerotia, protein synthesis is suppressed at 
      the level of initiation. To test the possibility that alterations in the 
      cytoskeleton may limit protein synthesis, we have examined the distribution of 
      polysomes and actin mRNA in the cytoskeletal (CSK) and soluble (SOL) fractions of 
      Triton X-100-extracted plasmodia and sclerotia. Most of the polysomes and actin mRNA 
      were located in the CSK of plasmodia, while most of the ribosomes and actin mRNA 
      were located in the SOL of sclerotia. The results suggest that ribosomes and mRNA 
      shift from the CSK to the SOL as protein synthesis is suppressed during starvation. 
      Plasmodia and sclerotia can be induced to accumulate excess polysomes by treatment 
      with low levels of the elongation inhibitor cycloheximide. Treatment of plasmodia 
      with cycloheximide caused excess polysomes to accumulate in the SOL, suggesting that 
      the CSK contains a limited capacity for binding translational components and that 
      the association of polysomes with the cytoskeleton is not required for protein 
      synthesis. Treatment of sclerotia with cycloheximide, however, caused polysomes and 
      actin mRNA to accumulate in the CSK, suggesting that the sclerotial cytoskeleton, 
      although depleted in ribosomes and mRNA, is capable of binding translational 
      components. It is concluded that alterations in the sclerotial cytoskeleton are not 
      involved in translational control.

PG  - 8519-33
AB  - We have used S1 nuclease to map the initiation site of ribosomal RNA transcription 
      in the acellular slime mold Physarum polycephalum, and we have determined the 
      sequence of 1011 nucleotides surrounding the start site. Consistent with others' 
      observations, there is little homology with the comparable region of other species. 
      As predicted by previous restriction mapping, direct repeats roughly 30 base pairs 
      in length are present upstream of the initiation site and a 148 base pair 
      duplication occurs in the external transcribed spacer. The results also suggest the 
      presence of a processing site within the external transcribed spacer of the 
      ribosomal transcription unit.

TI  - Biological oxidation and the mobilization of mitochondrial calcium during the 
      differentiation of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 311-6
AB  - We have previously reported that calcium is required for the starvation-induced 
      differentiation of the slime mold, Physarum polycephalum. With the exception of 
      calcium, each component of the complex starvation medium may be withheld and the 
      organism will still differentiate into spherules. The results of the present study 
      reveal that spherulation will proceed normally when the microplasmoidal cells are 
      transferred from nutrient medium to a citrate buffer containing only 8 mM CaCl2. 
      Electron microscopy and X-ray microprobe analysis reveal that there is an initial 
      increase in the population of calcium-containing mitochondrial granules when the 
      microplasmodia are induced to differentiate. However, as differentiation proceeds, 
      these granules decrease in number and are virtually absent from the mitochondria of 
      mature spherules. The accumulation and depletion of calcium-containing granules is 
      not observed in a nondifferentiating strain of Physarum cultured under standard 
      conditions, but is observed when this strain is first treated with a 
      calcium-enriched nutrient medium that conditions it for spherulation. Changes in the 
      cellular concentrations of NADH and lipid peroxides, and in the activity of 
      superoxide dismutase, correspond temporally to the pattern of increase and depletion 
      of the calcium-containing inclusions. The oxidative stress associated with 
      starvation-induced spherulation may be a consequence of the active accumulation of 
      calcium; the mobilization of this calcium may then be the event that initiates 
      differentiation.

TI  - Molecular cloning of mRNAs expressed specifically during spherulation of Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 234-43
AB  - A cDNA library was constructed using the poly(A)+ RNA extracted from spherulating 
      Physarum polycephalum microplasmodia. This library (740 clones) was screened by 
      differential hybridization with 32P-labeled poly(A)+ RNA from growing plasmodia and 
      developing spherules. The results showed that at least 30% of the clones 
      corresponded to mRNAs expressed specifically in spherulating plasmodia. The 35 
      spherulation-specific cDNA clones giving the strongest hybridization signals were 
      analysed. From this group, four different sequences complementary to very abundant 
      mRNAs were identified. They each accounted for 1.5% of 4.5% of all the clones in the 
      library and probably represented the most abundant spherulation-specific mRNAs. In 
      addition, four less abundant mRNAs were identified from stage-specific clones giving 
      weaker hybridization signals. These sequences represented individually between 0.3% 
      and 0.7% of the clones in the library. Northern blots showed that these eight 
      different sequences were absent from plasmodia and were most abundant 24-36 h after 
      the induction of spherulation. Similar results were also obtained when spherulation 
      was induced by the addition of a sublethal concentration of ferrous iron ions to the 
      growth medium. Hybridization of the spherule-specific clones to Southern blots of 
      genomic DNA suggested the presence of one copy for each gene.

      certain hypotheses on the chemical regulation of cytogel contraction we formulate a 
      model for the rhythmic contractions of plasmodia in the slime mold Physarum 
      polycephalum which is in accord with a number of experimental observations.

TI  - Change in chromatin organization related to in vivo transcriptional activity and 
      histone synthesis independent of DNA replication during differentiation 
      (germination) of Physarum spherules.
PG  - 149-156
LID - 10.1007/BF00188713 [doi]
AB  - During the germination of Physarum spherules, increases have been observed, at the 
      same moment, in the level of in vivo transcriptional activity as measured by [(3)H] 
      uridine incorporation, and the accessibility of DNA for ethidium bromide staining as 
      shown by flow cytometric measurements. We suppose that the changes observed in these 
      two processes are due to a difference in chromatin organization between the first 
      and the second period of the premitotic germination stage. In the second period, the 
      four nucleosome core histories are synthesized in the absence of DNA replication and 
      may correspond to a replacement of spherulation histone variants by plasmodial 
      histone types in nucleosomes. The synthesis of historic H(4) clearly distinguishes 
      the second period of the premitotic germination stage from a growing plasmodium G(2) 
      phase, though nuclei exhibit a G(2) phase DNA content. The same pattern of histone 
      synthesis has been found during the cell cycle following the first mitosis after 
      germination and the growing plasmodium cell cycle, with a synthesis of two histories 
      H(2)B and H(2)A and the high mobility group (HMG)-like protein AS(3) during the G(2) 
      phase, i.e. in the absence of DNA synthesis.

TI  - Myosin switching during amoebo-plasmodial differentiation of slime mold, Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 74-84
AB  - We reported previously that myosins from amoebal and plasmodial stages in the life 
      cycle of Physarum polycephalum differ in the primary structure of heavy chains and 
      phosphorylatable 18,000 Mr light chains, while Ca-binding 14,000 Mr light chains are 
      common to both myosins (Kohama & Takano-Ohmuro, Proc Jpn acad 60B (1984) 431; Kohama 
      et al., J biol chem 260 (1986) 8022). We have carried out immunofluorescence 
      microscopical studies upon differentiating cultures of amoebic colonies, which show 
      apogamic amoebo-plasmodial differentiation as follows: Typical amoebae differentiate 
      into mono-nucleate intermediate cells with swollen nuclei and then into two or 
      multi-nucleate young plasmodia (Anderson et al., Protoplasma 89 (1976) 29. 
      Antibodies against plasmodial myosin heavy chain (PMHC) and 18,000 Mr plasmodial 
      myosin light chain (PMLC18) stained intermediate cells and young plasmodia, but not 
      typical amoebae. On the other hand, antibody against amoebal myosin heavy chain 
      (AMHC) stained typical amoebae and intermediate cells--but not young plasmodia. Thus 
      staining was detected using antibodies against both PMHC and AMHC in intermediate 
      cells. Intermediate cells were also stained by antibody against another 
      plasmodium-specific cytoskeletal protein, viz., high molecular weight actin-binding 
      protein (HMWP). We propose that synthesis of myosin subunits switches immediately 
      from amoebal to plasmodial type in mono-nucleate cells with swollen nuclei. This 
      myosin switching is associated with the initiation of HMWP synthesis.

PG  - 675-91
AB  - The influence of inhibitors of respiration (KCN), glycolysis (2-deoxy-D-glucose 
      alone or in combination with monoiodo-acetate) and anaerobic conditions (N2 or 95% 
      N2 + 5% CO2), as well as the effect of application of appropriate substrates 
      (D-glucose, sodium acetate, alpha-ketoglutarate and pyruvate) on contraction 
      behavior (of plasmodia) of Physarum polycephalum was investigated under low 
      intensity red-light illumination. Application of inhibitors of respiration or 
      glycolysis leads to significantly different periods of the force oscillations (2.0 
      +/- 0.4 min and 4.1 +/- 0.5 min, in the presence of inhibitors of glycolysis and 
      respiration, respectively). In both cases, the force amplitude of oscillations is 
      diminished in comparison to undisturbed energy production. The persistence of 
      oscillations in the presence of inhibitors of glycolysis seems to rule out an 
      exclusively glycolytic origin of the force oscillations. A continuous production of 
      ATP is necessary since a blockade of the energy production causes a cessation of the 
      oscillations. Application of substrates for respiration in the presence of 
      inhibitors of glycolysis leads to an increase in the force amplitude and a slight 
      prolongation of the oscillation period. In contrast, an application of glucose in 
      the presence of a respiration inhibitor has no effect on the force amplitude and 
      period.

TI  - Endoplasmic veins from plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum: a new strand model 
      defined age, structure, and behavior.
PG  - 1-9
AB  - Pure endoplasm from plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum taken up into glass pipettes 
      and subsequently extruded into water forms a long protoplasmic cylinder uniform in 
      diameter, which is designated as an "endoplasmic vein". This new experimentally 
      obtained model has proven advantageous for tensiometric investigation of contraction 
      activity. During the process of aging, this model undergoes processes of 1. actin 
      transformations, 2. cytoplasmic actomyosin fibrillogenesis and 3. development of a 
      new plasmalemma invagination system. Within approximately 20 min the newly formed 
      plasmalemma invaginations delimit an endoplasmic channel and shuttle streaming along 
      the longitudinal axis appears in the artificially generated protoplasmic strands. 
      The geometrical shape of this strand model permits unidirectional tensiometric 
      measurements of contractile and mechanical properties of the endoplasm during the 
      early stages of its transformation to an ectoplasmic tube. Tensiometric and 
      morphologic observations reveal that the process of actomyosin fibrillogenesis in 
      the early stage of development of endoplasmic veins is temporally correlated with an 
      increase in the force output under isometric conditions of tensiometric measurement. 
      Young's modulus, which represents mechanical properties of the model (0.8-1.4 X 
      10(5) dyne/cm2), is in the range of values observed in normal isolated protoplasmic 
      strands. The advantages of the new model for the investigation of cyclic contraction 
      behaviour are discussed.

      spherical and rod-shaped types, (b) ameboid types, and (c) symmetrical types. In 
      ameboid microplasmodia, the motive force for the irregular protoplasmic streaming 
      activity is generated by alternative contraction and relaxation of a 
      membrane-associated layer, morphologically consisting exclusively of thin filaments 
      (probably actin). The protoplasm flows along a hydraulic pressure gradient produced 
      by the filament layer within limited regions of the cell periphery. In 
      dumbbell-shaped microplasmodia the motive force for the regular protoplasmic shuttle 
      streaming between the two spherical heads is generated both by volume changes of the 
      peripheral cell region (caused by the contractile activity of the 
      membrane-associated filament layer), and by volume changes of the internal cell 
      membrane invagination system (caused by fibrils attached to the basal region of the 
      invaginations). The development from the unordered protoplasmic streaming pattern 
      and less complicated fine structural organization in ameboid microplasmodia to the 
      highly organized protoplasmic shuttle streaming and the more complicated morphology 
      in dumbbell-shaped microplasmodia can be explained by intermediate stages. Whereas 
      the motive force for the transport of smaller amounts of protoplasm can be generated 
      by the exclusive action of a cortical filament layer, the existence of a filament 
      cortex, the display of cytoplasmic fibrils, and the development of plasma membrane 
      invaginations appear to be a necessary precondition for the transport of large 
      amounts of protoplasm.

PG  - 51-9
AB  - Starting from only 5.9 mg of alpha-tubulin from myxamoebae of the slime mould 
      Physarum polycephalum, we have isolated and sequenced peptides that account for 96% 
      of the complete sequence. The peptides were generated by digestion of alpha-tubulin 
      with trypsin, Staphylococcus aureus protease and cyanogen bromide. They were then 
      separated according to size on a TSK G2000 SW column using a 10 mM ammonium acetate 
      buffer at pH 6.8. In addition to good peptide separations, a time-consuming 
      desalting step with subsequent loss of material was unnecessary because the 
      relatively small amount of ammonium acetate could be removed by lyophilization. High 
      resolution of peptides from the TSK fractions was achieved on C4 or C18 
      reverse-phase columns by eluting with a gradient of acetonitrile in 50 mM ammonium 
      acetate (pH 6.8) and in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, respectively. The peptides were 
      then sequenced using a gas phase sequencer.

PG  - 3323-39
AB  - The action of heparin on isolated nuclei derived from different phases of the 
      mitotic cycle in plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum was studied. Heparin addition at 
      two-fold excess over DNA concentration to nuclei in Mg-free low ionic strength 
      buffer (10 mM TRIS-HC1, 10 mM Na2 HPO4, pH = 8) releases 60-80% of chromatin from S, 
      G2, and mitotic phase nuclei. The RNA/protein ratio of herparin-solubilized cromatin 
      is constant through S and G2 phases, but rises about two-fold at early prophase 
      coincident with nucleolar breakdown. Purified nuclear envelopes were obtained from 
      heparin-treated nuclei by sedimentation according to Bornens procedures (Nature 244, 
      28, 1973), and examined by transmission electron microscopy. Residual chromatin is 
      seen at all stages with fine network of DNA fibrils in contact with the envelop. 
      Regardless of time in S, 80% of 3H-labeled DNA was released into soluble chromatin 
      with identical 3H/14C ratios. The residual chromatin in nuclear envelopes exhibited 
      a preferential association of early S-DNA in nuclei engaged in early S replication, 
      and late S preferential association in nuclei engaged in late S replication.

PG  - 1127-34
AB  - A contractile protein closely resembling natural actomyosin (myosin B) of rabbit 
      skeletal muscle was extracted from plasmodia of the slime mold, Physarum 
      polycephalum, by protecting the SH-groups with beta-mercaptoethanol or 
      dithiothreitol. Superprecipitation of the protein induced by Mg2+-ATP at low ionic 
      strength was observed only in the presence of very low concentrations of free Ca2+ 
      ions, and the Mg2+-ATPase [EC 3.6.1.3] reaction was activated 2- to 6-fold by 1 muM 
      of free Ca2+ ions. Crude myosin and actin fractions were separated by centrifuging 
      plasmodium myosin B in the presence of Mg2+-PPi at high ionic strength. The crude 
      myosin showed both EDTA- and Ca2+-activated ATPase activities. The Mg2+-ATPase 
      activity of crude myosin from plasmodia was markedly activated by the addition of 
      pure F-actin from rabbit skeletal muscle. Addition of the F-action-regulatory 
      protein complex prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle as well as the actin fraction 
      of plasmodium caused the same degree of activation as the addition of pure F-actin 
      only in the presence of very low concentrations of Ca2+ ion

TI  - Isolation and Characterization of an Extracellular Polysaccharide from Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 1110-8
AB  - The myxomycetes are called slime molds because of the synthesis of copious amounts 
      of extracellular material (slime) during parts of the life cycle. In Physarum 
      polycephalum, small amounts of slime are produced during exponential growth of 
      microplasmodia in shake flasks, but the amount of this slime increased 10- to 
      20-fold at 16 to 34 hr after microplasmodia were induced to form spherules by 
      transferring them to salt solution. The slime obtained during both periods is the 
      same; an acidic polysaccharide consisting of galactose, sulfate, and trace amounts 
      of rhamnose. Analysis of the galactose-to-sulfate ratio gave a value of about 4 to 
      1. Infrared spectroscopy showed increased absorbance at 820 cm(-1) characteristic of 
      C-O-S vibrations. Electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gel revealed that the material 
      moved as a single band which stained with Alcian Blue and periodic acid Shiff 
      reagent. However, fractionation of identical material on Dowex columns and 
      electrophoresis on cellulose acetate showed the slime to be made up of three major 
      fractions. The polysaccharide appeared as an extracellular capsule closely adhering 
      to the walls of the spherules. It could be separated from the wall by vigorous 
      shaking. The increased synthesis of slime during spherulation was not blocked by 
      cycloheximide, suggesting that new enzyme synthesis was not necessary for its 
      formation.

TI  - The localization of the divergent beta 2-tubulin isotype in the microtubular arrays 
      of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 217-26
AB  - The beta 2-tubulin isotype of Physarum polycephalum is only 83% identical in amino 
      acid sequence with the constitutively expressed beta 1B-tubulin and the 
      myxamoeba-specific beta 1A-tubulin isotypes. A polyclonal antibody specific for beta 
      2-tubulin was used to monitor the subcellular distribution of the beta 2-tubulin 
      antigen in the mitotic spindle of the mature plasmodium - the sole microtubular 
      array in that stage of Physarum. By immunofluorescence, the beta 2-tubulin antigen 
      was detected throughout this anastral mitotic spindle, at all stages of mitosis. 
      Physarum myxamoebae contain astral mitotic spindles and cytoskeletal microtubules. 
      No beta 2-tubulin antigen was detected in the myxamoebal stage. However, as cultures 
      of myxamoebae developed into plasmodia, the beta 2-tubulin antigen was found in the 
      astral mitotic spindles and cytoskeletons in developing cells. Thus, the presence of 
      the plasmodial beta 2-tubulin isotype in a mitotic spindle does not determine a 
      closed, anastral mitosis.

PG  - 4142-7
AB  - High mobility group like (HMG-like) nuclear proteins were isolated from plasmodia of 
      the lower eucaryote Physarum polycephalum and characterized by different types of 
      polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The synthesis of these proteins was measured 
      during the naturally synchronous cell cycle of Physarum. The four HMG-like proteins 
      (AS1-4) exhibit a pronounced cell cycle dependent pattern of synthesis: AS1 and AS4 
      have a clear maximum of synthesis in mid S phase with a basal synthesis during the 
      entire G2 period. In contrast, AS2 and AS3 have little synthesis in S phase but a 
      broad maximum in mid G2 period. The four HMG-like proteins have a very low synthesis 
      in early S phase and late G2 period. In addition, other non-histone proteins, which 
      are coextracted with the HMG proteins, exhibit distinct periodic synthesis patterns. 
      A novel non-histone protein, which is the most abundant protein species in 0.35 M 
      NaCl extracts, was detected. It exhibits a high rate of synthesis around the time of 
      mitosis. In general, the results indicate that, in contrast to the main cytoplasmic 
      proteins, most nuclear proteins are phase-specific with respect to their synthesis 
      in the cell cycle.

TI  - Identification and changes in activity of five thymidine kinase forms during the 
      cell cycle of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 159-64
AB  - Five forms of thymidine kinase have been identified on isoelectric focusing gels of 
      Physarum polycephalum supernatants. Their isoelectric points are 5.9, 6.4, 6.7, 6.9 
      and 7.1. All are inhibited by deoxythymidine 5'-triphosphate (dTTP). The activity of 
      the pI 7.1 form does not change significantly during the cell cycle. The other four 
      forms change in activity. About 1 h before metaphase the activity of the four more 
      acidic forms is first detected. Their activity peaks during telophase, and by 1 h 
      after metaphase there is a 50% decrease in activity of the 5.9 form. By 3 h after 
      metaphase the activity of the 6.4 form has dropped more sharply than the activity of 
      the 6.7 form. By 6 h after metaphase only the activity of the 6.9 form is present in 
      significant amounts in addition to the 7.1 form. The activity of these new acidic 
      forms probably accounts for the reported increase in total thymidine kinase activity 
      during mitosis and early S phase.

TI  - Nuclear DNA content and chromosome numbers throughout the life cycle of the Colonia 
      strain of the myxomycete, Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 95-108
AB  - Nuclear DNA content and ploidy have been determined at different stages of the life 
      cycle of the Colonia strain of the myxomycete Physarum polycephalum. Analyses at the 
      plasmodial stage showed that (a) Burton and Fuelgen DNA analyses agreed within 15% 
      with strains which ranged from 0-6 to 3-6 pg of DNA per nucleus; (b) S-phase in 
      Colonia is during the early part of interphase as in the Wisconsin strain; (c) in 
      heterothallic and heterothallic x Colonia crossed strains there are 1-0-1-2 pg of 
      DNA and 70 chromosomes per nucleus and in Colonia 0-6 pg of DNA and 40 chromosomes. 
      Germinating spores of all strains contained one population of cells with about 0-5 
      pg of DNA and 40 chromosomes and another of larger cells with up to 2-5 pg of DNA 
      and 200 chromosomes. The polyploid nuclei comprised 2-20% of the total in 
      heterothallic strains, 2-65% in heterothallic x Colonia crosses and 25-75% in 
      Colonia. A method was devised for making chromosome spreads of amoebae grown on 
      bacterial lawns. Cells were first exposed to dilute formaldehyde at 26 degrees C for 
      30 min, then spread on slides with hot lactic acid and strained. Such spreads of CLd 
      (Colonia) and RSD4 (heterothallic) amoebae both contained about 40 chromosomes. The 
      data are consistent with the view that Colonia is haploid throughout its life cycle 
      and that chromosome number is neither halved during sporulation nor doubled during 
      plasmoidal formation. However, the possibility exists that an alternance of ploidy 
      occurs by way of the few diploid nuclei present in the plasmodium.

TI  - ADP-ribosylation in isolated nuclei of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 859-67
AB  - ADP-ribosylation of histones and non-histone nuclear proteins was studied in 
      isolated nuclei during the naturally synchronous cell cycle of Physarum 
      polycephalum. Aside from ADP-ribosyltransferase (ADPRT) itself, histones and high 
      mobility group-like proteins are the main acceptors for ADP-ribose. The majority of 
      these ADP-ribose residues is NH2OH-labile. ADP-ribosylation of the nuclear proteins 
      is periodic during the cell cycle with maximum incorporation in early to mid 
      G2-phase. In activity gels two enzyme forms with Mr of 115,000 and 75,000 can be 
      identified. Both enzyme forms are present at a constant ratio of 3:1 during the cell 
      cycle. The higher molecular mass form cannot be converted in vitro to the low 
      molecular mass form, excluding an artificial degradation during isolation of nuclei. 
      The ADPRT forms were purified and separated by h.p.l.c. The low molecular mass form 
      is inhibited by different ADPRT inhibitors to a stronger extent and is the main 
      acceptor for auto-ADP-ribosylation. The high molecular mass form is only moderately 
      auto-ADP-ribosylated.

TI  - Acetylation and methylation sites in histone H4 from Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 245-52
AB  - Histone H4 has been isolated and purified from plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum. 
      The four major fragments produced by hydrolysis of H4 by acetic acid were separated 
      and the complete amino acid sequence of two of them was determined. By analogy with 
      calf H4, these peptides are at the C-terminus and give the sequence from residue 68 
      to the C-terminus (residue 102). In this 35 residue sequence there are two minor 
      differences from calf H4: (i) residue 77 is arginine in Physarum H4 and lysine in 
      calf H4; (ii) lysine-79 is partially methylated in Physarum. Arginine occurs at 
      position 77 in pea H4 but the occurrence of methylated lysine at position 79 has not 
      been reported for other species. In the N-terminal region, amino acid compositions 
      of acetic acid, tryptic and chymotryptic peptides indicate that Physarum H4 and calf 
      H4 have identical sequences from the N-terminus to residue 47. There may be minor 
      differences in the region from residue 46 to residue 67. The sites of acetylation 
      were determined by Edman degradation of acetate-labelled peptide 4-17 of Physarum 
      H4. Acetylation was observed at positions 5, 8, 12, and 16. The only other labelled 
      peptide was the N-terminal peptide, which is not susceptible to Edman degradation 
      and is thus probably alpha-N-acetylated as in most other organisms. The results 
      confirm the conservation of H4 sequence and place Physarum H4 in an intermediate 
      position between lower eukaryote H4, such as yeast or Tetrahymena H4, and higher 
      eukaryote H4, such as mammalian H4 or pea H4.

TI  - Polyamine-mediated phosphorylation of a nucleolar protein from Physarum polycephalum 
      that stimulates rRNA synthesis.
PG  - 2541-5
AB  - An acidic nucleolar phosphoprotein with a subunit M(r) of 70,000 was purified as an 
      apparent dimer of 139,000 from isolated nuclei of the slime mold Physarum 
      polycephalum. The protein was purified without the aid of strong dissociating agents 
      after its selective phosphorylation in isolated nuclei by a polyamine-mediated 
      reaction. Its amino acid composition resembled that of a nucleolar phosphoprotein 
      from Novikoff hepatoma ascites cells. The phosphoprotein stimulated rRNA synthesis 
      5-fold by RNA polymerase I within a nucleolar, ribosomal deoxyribonucleoprotein 
      complex isolated from nucleoli of P. polycephalum. It was also identified as a 
      component of the complex. It bound with high affinity and specificity to the 
      palindromic ribosomal DNA of 38 x 10(6)M(r) from P. polycephalum, which contained 
      two coding sequences for 5.8S, 19S, and 26S rRNA. It also bound to three fragments 
      of ribosomal DNA of M(r) 21.2 x 10(6), 17.1 x 10(6), and 8.1 x 10(6), prepared by 
      cleavage with restriction endonucleases HindIII, PstI, and BamHI, respectively. All 
      of these fragments included the symmetry axis of the palindromic ribosomal DNA. The 
      phosphoprotein that had been treated with alkaline phosphataseagarose to hydrolyze 
      the phosphate groups did not stimulate transcription and did not bind to ribosomal 
      DNA or to the restriction fragments indicated. We have thus isolated a specific 
      phosphoprotein with the capacity to stimulate transcription of a specific set of 
      genes in a eukaryote. These findings suggest that this phosphoprotein may 
      specifically regulate functions of ribosomal DNA in a manner dependent on its degree 
      of phosphorylation.

TI  - Specificity of sterol-glucosylating enzymes from Sinapis alba and Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 363-70
AB  - 1. Sinapis alba L. seedlings contain glycosyltransferase catalyzing the synthesis of 
      sterol glucosides in the presence of UDPglucose as sugar donor. The major activity 
      occurs in the membranous fraction sedimenting at 300--9000 x g. Successive treatment 
      of the particulate enzyme fraction with acetone and Triton X-100 affords a soluble 
      glucosyltransferase preparation which can be partly purified by gel filtration on 
      Sephadex G-150. Molecular weight of the glucosyltransferase is 1.4 . 10(5). Apparent 
      Km values for UDPglucose and sitosterol are 8.0 . 10(-5) M and 5.0 . 10(-6) M, 
      respectively. 2. Comparison was made of the S. alba glucosyltransferase with a 
      similar sterol-glucosylating enzyme isolated from non-photosynthesizing organism 
      Physarum polycephalum (Myxomycetes). UDPglucose was the most efficient glucose donor 
      in both cases but the enzyme from Ph. polycephalum can also utilize CDPglucose and 
      TDPglucose. Glucose acceptors are, in case of both enzymes, sterols containing a 
      beta-OH group at C-3 and a planar ring system (5 alpha-H or double bond at C-5). The 
      number and position of double bonds in the ring system and in the side chain, as 
      well as the presence of additional alkyl groups in the side chain at C-24 are of 
      secondary importance. 3. The present results indicate that both enzymes can be 
      regarded as specific UDPglucose:sterol glucosyltransferases. Certain differences in 
      their specificity towards donors and acceptors of the glucosyl moiety suggest, 
      however, a different structure of the active sites in both enzymes.

AB  - The plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum has attracted much attention due its 
      intelligent adaptive behavior. In this study, we constructed a model of the organism 
      and attempted to simulate its locomotion and morphogenetic behavior. By modifying 
      our previous model, we were able to get closer to the actual behavior. We also 
      compared the behavior of the model with that of the real organism, demonstrating 
      remarkable similarity between the two.

AB  - Negatively stained slime mold actomyosin examined by electron microscopy consists 
      mainly of actin-like filaments with occasional angular projections. If some of the

      structures similar to those of vertebrate striated muscle actomyosin. Together with 
      other evidence, the findings suggest that cytoplasmic streaming in Physarum may 
      involve a contractile process operating at a relatively low myosin-actin ratio.

LID - 10.1007/BF00214663 [doi]
AB  - Fluorescently labeled actin (TRITC-G-actin) and heavy meromyosin (TRITC-HMM) derived 
      from skeletal muscle and injected into microplasmodia of the acellular slime mold 
      Physarum polycephalum were used to analyze the function of a cortical and fibrillar 
      actin system in living specimens. The plasma membrane-attached cortical system can 
      be labeled with TRITC-G-actin as well as with TRITC-HMM and visualized as a 
      continuous sheath along the entire cell surface. Long-term experiments over time 
      periods of several hours in conjunction with digital grey-value evaluations revealed 
      that changes in the intensity of the fluorescent signal, as caused by alternative 
      contraction and relaxation cycles of the cortical system, are distinctly correlated 
      with periodic changes in the volume and shuttle streaming activity of the 
      microplasmodia. The fibrillar actin system extending through the cytoplasmic matrix 
      can be labeled only with TRITC-HMM. Formation and disappearance of fibrils were 
      found to take place during relaxation and contraction of the cortical system, 
      respectively. Results of the present paper indicate that the cortical actin system 
      is mainly involved in motive force generation for alterations in cell surface 
      morphology and locomotion activity, whereas the fibrillar actin system rather 
      appears to maintain the mechanical stability of microplasmodia.

PG  - 225-32
AB  - The change of the nuclear pore frequency during the nuclear cycle of synchronous 
      plasmodia of Physaru- polycephalum was investigated. Counts were made on 
      platinum-carbon replicas of isolated nuclei. Pore numbers varied markedly at any 
      given time of the nuclear cycle, possibly due to the variable DNA contents of the 
      nuclei. The average pore frequency per nucleus increased from 336 at 1 h after 
      mitosis to 770 at 50 min before the subsequent mitosis. The results suggest a 
      quantitative relation between the nuclear DNA content and pore frequency. This is 
      compatible with the hypothesis that pore complexes serve as attachment sites for 
      nuclear DNA.

TI  - Specificity and direction of depolymerization of beta-poly(L-malate) catalysed by 
      polymalatase from Physarum polycephalum--fluorescence labeling at the 
      carboxy-terminus of beta-poly(L-malate).
PG  - 308-14
AB  - Beta-poly(L-malate), a major constituent of nuclei in plasmodia of Physarum 
      polycephalum, is enzymatically degraded to L-malate after secretion into the culture 
      medium. This depolymerization is specifically catalysed by an endogenous 
      polymalatase. The mode of action and the specificity criteria have been investigated 
      by employing various chemical derivatives of beta-poly(L-malate), including 
      substitution at the hydroxy-terminus and carboxy-terminus of the polymer, 
      esterification of the pending alpha-carboxylate, and beta-poly(DL-malate). The 
      results of the investigation were summarized in a specificity model that involved 
      recognition of the hydroxy-terminus and of the alpha-carboxylate as substituents of 
      the asymmetric carbon in the malic acid unit. Depolymerization proceeded from the 
      hydroxy-terminus towards the carboxy-terminus, thereby degrading the polymer to 
      L-malate. When the terminal beta-carboxylate had been amidated with the fluorescent 
      N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine, degradation was normal but was arrested at the level 
      of the terminal beta-carboxy-substituted dimer. It should be possible to employ 
      polymalatase as a tool for the detection of branching and other modifications of 
      beta-poly(L-malate).

PG  - 203-11
AB  - In Physarum polycephalum the rRNA genes are present on linear extrachromosomal 
      molecules, each containing two transcription units arranged as a giant palindrome. 
      In the center of the molecule, between the two transcription units, is the 23-kb 
      central spacer, previously shown to contain the replication origins and several 
      regions of direct and inverted repeats. Segments of all the repeats in the spacer 
      have been sequenced and their overall organization determined. The entire spacer 
      consists of reiterations of only 1200 bp of different DNA sequences. The sequence 
      surrounding the transcription start point is not repeated in the spacer, as it is in 
      Xenopus and Drosophila. Sequencing of purified, uncloned rDNA localized some of the 
      methylcytosine residues in the spacer. The repetitious sequences appear to be 
      undergoing concerted evolution.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of a high molecular weight actin-binding protein from 
      Physarum polycephalum plasmodia.
PG  - 1611-8
AB  - A high molecular weight actin-binding protein was isolated from the Physarum 
      polycephalum plasmodia. The protein ( HMWP ) shares many properties with other high 
      molecular weight actin-binding proteins such as spectrin, actin-binding protein from 
      macrophages, and filamin. It has a potent activity to cross-link F-actin into a 
      gel-like structure. Its cross-linking activity does not depend on calcium 
      concentrations. Hydrodynamic studies have revealed that the protein is in the 
      monomeric state of a polypeptide chain with molecular weight of approximately 
      230,000 in a high ionic strength solvent, while it self-associates into a dimer 
      under physiological ionic conditions. Electron microscopic examinations of HMWP have 
      shown that the monomer particle observed in a high ionic strength solvent is rod 
      shaped with the two-stranded morphology very similar to that of spectrin. On the 
      other hand, under physiological ionic conditions, the HMWP dimer shows the dumb-bell 
      shape with two globular domains connected with a thin flexible strand.

TI  - Accessibility of the ribosomal genes to micrococcal nuclease in Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 452-63
AB  - In Physarum polycephalum most genes coding for ribosomal RNA are not integrated in 
      chromosomes, but are located in many copies in the nucleolus as plasmid-like 
      palindromic DNA molecules. To find out whether coding sequences of rDNA are 
      organized in a chromatin-like structure similar to that of bulk chromatin, nuclei 
      were treated with micrococcal nuclease and DNA fragments were isolated. From bulk 
      chromatin multimers of a basic unit of 170-180 base pairs were obtained. Nuclease 
      fragmented DNA hybridized with labelled 19-S + 26-S rRNA was found to give the same 
      saturation value as did unfragmented control DNA. No preferential degradation of 
      ribosomal genes to acid soluble products was observed. A more detailed analysis of 
      the nuclease degradation products was carried out with fragments separated by 
      preparative gel electrophoresis. DNA eluted from the gels was hybridized in solution 
      with labelled 19-S + 26-S rRNA. The coding sequences of rRNA were found to be 
      degraded to approximately nucleosome size slightly more quickly than was the DNA of 
      bulk chromatin. However, the distribution of the rDNA fragments on the gels did not 
      coincide with the distribution of the fragments derived from bulk chromatin 
      nucleosomes and their oligomers. The amount of rDNA in the interband regions was 
      about intermediate between that found in the two adjacent bands. These results lead 
      to the conclusion that the ribosomal genes, most of which are presumably active 
      during rapid growth, are protected by proteins, probably histones. However, the 
      ribosomal genes are present in a structure differing in some way from that of bulk 
      chromatin.

      Physarum polycephalum. Developmental regulation of the ribosomal gene number.
PG  - 507-12
AB  - The composition of repetitive sequences in restriction patterns of nuclear DNA of 
      Physarum polycephalum was determined by high-resolution gel analysis. Three types of 
      repeated DNA fragments in the size range of (0.2-2) X 10(3) base pairs could be 
      identified as discrete spots on the gels and distinguished by their abundance and 
      above-average base composition of either guanine and cytosine (G + C) or adenine and 
      thymidine (A + T). On comparing the DNA composition from exponentially growing 
      plasmodia with that of starved plasmodia, which have become competent to sporulate 
      and have lost 80% of their nuclei, no change was detected among the (A + T)-rich 
      repeat fractions, whereas several of the (G + C)-rich fractions revealed fewer 
      copies in the DNA prepared from starved cells. As shown by hybridization under 
      saturating conditions, the reduction of several (G + C)-rich repeated sequences in 
      the restricted nuclear DNA in sporulation-competent cells can be explained by a 64% 
      elimination of the extrachromosomal nucleolar ribosomal DNA sequences.

TI  - Membrane histochemistry of Physarum polycephalum myxamoebae.
PG  - 1261-7
AB  - Myxamoebae of Physarum polycephalum are the uninucleate, haploid stage of the 
      organism. Histochemical studies were undertaken to characterize intracellular and 
      plasma membranes, and to provide a basis for assaying subcellular fractions for 
      enrichment in plasma membranes. Lead salts deposition techniques were employed for 
      hydrolytic enzymes. Alcian blue-ruthenium red, osmium tetroxide-potassium 
      ferrocyanide, and phosphotungstic acid-chromic acid stains were evaluated for 
      specificity for plasma membranes. Glucose 6-phosphatase was localized in endoplasmic 
      reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and perinuclear space. 5'-Nucleotidase was localized in 
      food vacuoles, chromatin, and plasmalemma. Acid phosphatase was in food vacuoles and 
      Golgi apparatus. Alkaline phosphatase was in food vacuoles and endoplasmic 
      reticulum. We conclude that none of the above enzymes is suitable as a cytochemical 
      marker for plasma membranes of Physarum myxamoebae, but recommend instead staining 
      ultrathin sections of membrane pellets with phosphotungstic acid-chromic acid, which 
      stains plasma membranes selectively.

AB  - Electron microscopic and autoradiographic analysis of replicating DNA from Physarum 
      showed that replication occurs at a rate of 0.4 micron/min/per replicon and that 
      replicons of size 10--15 mu occur in temporal clusters with an average of about 4

TI  - [Cytomechanics of oscillatory contractions. Modeling the longitudinal dynamics of 
      Physarum polycephalum protoplasmic strands].
PG  - 1083-93
AB  - A mathematical model of the longitudinal dynamics of an isolated strand of the 
      Physarum polycephalum plasmodium has been constructed. Its contractile system is 
      considered as a continual viscoelastic medium with passive and active components. 
      The mathematical description of the longitudinal dynamics of the plasmodial strand 
      is reduced to a system of three first-order differential equations, whose variables 
      are its active stress, deformation, and the intracellular concentration of calcium 
      ions. The model is based on the hypothesis that there exists a feedback loop, which 
      appears because of the influence of strand stretching on the rate of the release of 
      calcium ions, which in turn controls the active contraction and deformation of the 
      strand. Nonlinear interactions between the variables evoke a loss of the stationary 
      state stability and a self-excitation of mechanochemical autooscillations when the 
      external load exceeds some critical value. The results of numerical solutions of the 
      model with the empirically determined viscoelastic parameters are in good agreement 
      with the available experimental data and testify to the adequacy of the description 
      of strand dynamics by the mathematical model in which the contractile apparatus is a 
      part of the cellular control system. In particular, this model well simulates the 
      form and duration of transient mechanochemical processes observed under isotonic and 
      isometric conditions immediately after strand isolation, as well as the subsequent 
      excitation of autooscillations of the contractile activity and their activation by 
      strand stretching.

TI  - Identification of a second retrotransposon-related element in the genome of Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 403-8
AB  - The repetitive fraction of the genome of the eukaryotic slime mould Physarum 
      polycephalum is dominated by Tp1, a family of retrotransposon-like sequences. Tp1 
      elements are arranged in scrambled clusters probably arising from integration of the 
      element into copies of its own sequence. The present report describes a second 
      sequence family, Tp2, which has been identified within cloned DNA segments of 
      scrambled Tp1 sequences. Like Tp1, the Tp2 element is structurally related to 
      retrotransposons, having long terminal direct repeats and being flanked by an 
      apparent target site duplication, but its relatively short length (1.68 kb) 
      indicates that it is probably incapable of encoding all the functions necessary for 
      its own mobilisation. Analysis of the coding potential of the Tp2 element supports 
      this view, although a striking homology to a nucleic acid binding domain common to 
      many retrotransposons was identified. As with Tp1, putative regulatory signals can 
      be identified in the LTRs of Tp2. Identical arrangements of Tp2 with respect to Tp1 
      in more than one independently derived clone indicate that non-functional copies of 
      Tp2 may be mobilised as part of a Tp1 transcriptional unit.

TI  - Organization of DNA replication in Physarum polycephalum. Attachment of origins of 
      replicons and replication forks to the nuclear matrix.
PG  - 1181-95
AB  - We have investigated the attachment of the DNA to the nuclear matrix during the 
      division cycle of the plasmodial slime mold Physarum polycephalum. The DNA of 
      plasmodia was pulse labelled at different times during the S phase and the label 
      distribution was studied by graded DNase digestion of the matrix-DNA complexes 
      prepared from nuclei isolated by extraction with 2 M NaCl. Pulse labelled DNA was 
      preferentially recovered from the matrix bound residual DNA at any time of the S 
      phase. Label incorporated at the onset of the S phase remained preferentially 
      associated with the matrix during the G2 phase and the subsequent S phase. The 
      occurrence of the pulse label in the matrix associated DNA regions was transiently 
      elevated at the onset of the subsequent S phase. Label incorporated at the end of 
      the S phase was located at DNA regions which, in the G2 phase, were preferentially 
      released from the matrix by DNase treatment. From the results and previously 
      reported data on the distribution of attachment sites it can be concluded that 
      origins of replicons or DNA sites very close to them are attached to the matrix 
      during the entire nuclear cycle. The data further indicate that initiations of DNA 
      replication occur at the same origins in successive S phases. Replicating DNA is 
      bound to the matrix, in addition, by the replication fork or a region close to it. 
      This binding is loosened after completion of the replication.

TI  - Identification and characterization of microtubule proteins from myxamoebae of 
      Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 305-12
AB  - Cell extracts of myxamoebae of Physarum polycephalum have been prepared in such a 
      way that they do not inhibit assembly of brain microtubule protein in vitro even at 
      high extract-protein concentration. Co-polymers of these extracts and brain tubulin 
      have been purified to constant stoichiometry and amoebal components identified by 
      radiolabelling. Amoebal tubulin has been identified as having an alpha-subunit, 
      mol.wt. 54 000, which co-migrates with brain alpha-tubulin and a beta-subunit, 
      mol.wt. 50 000, which co-migrates with Tetrahymena ciliary beta-tubulin. Non-tubulin 
      amoebal proteins that co-purify with tubulin during co-polymer formation have been 
      shown to be essential for microtubule formation in the absence of glycerol and 
      appear to be rather more effective than brain microtubule-associated proteins in 
      stimulating assembly. The mitotic inhibitor griseofulvin 
      (7-chloro-2',4,6-trimethoxy-6'-methylspiro[benzofuran-2(3H),1'-cyclohex-2'-ene] 
      -3,4'-dione), which binds to brain microtubule-associated proteins and inhibits 
      brain microtubule assembly in vitro, affected co-polymer microtubule protein in a 
      similar way, but to a slightly greater extent.

      beta-gamma-imido ATP analog, inhibited the ATPase activity of Physarum myosin 
      competitively with Ki values equal to 350 and 12 muM in the presence of Ca2+ and 
      Mg2+, respectively. The ATPase activity of Physarum myosin was inhibited at a very 
      low rate (t1/2 = 24 h) by the ATP analog, 6,6'-dithiobis(inosinyl imidodiphosphate), 
      with concentrations of inhibitor previously shown to inactivate (t1/2 approximately 
      10 min) skeletal and cardiac myosins rapidly by reacting with key cysteines.

      alpha- and beta-tubulin.
PG  - 141-6
AB  - Photo-induced fruiting-body formation of the slime mold Physarum polycephalum can be 
      divided into two stages. The first stage (I) starts with the beginning of 
      illumination (0 h) and ends with the formation of nodules (12 h). The second stage 
      (II) is characterized by culmination, sporangiophore formation and melanization of 
      sporangiophore heads (13-17 h). We investigated the expression of actin, alpha- and 
      beta-tubulin during this differentiation process using Northern blot analysis and 
      run-off transcription in isolated nuclei. Whereas actin mRNA is irreversibly lost 
      during stage I, we observed two peaks in mRNA concentration for alpha-tubulin and 
      one peak for that of beta-tubulin during stage I and a coordinated 
      alpha/beta-tubulin mRNA induction during stage II. Stage II induction appears to be 
      related to a presporangial mitosis. Transcriptional activity of the three genes 
      studied shows two maxima, namely one in the middle of stage I and the other at the 
      end of stage II. Our data suggest that the expression of the three cytoskeletal 
      proteins investigated follows a distinct temporal pattern comprising changes in both 
      mRNA synthesis and decay. We also propose a novel function of tubulin in Physarum 
      which is not related to mitosis.

TI  - Cycloheximide resistance of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 897-905
AB  - In the presence of cycloheximide, wild-type plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum 
      exhibit an immediate decrease in deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis, a reduction in the 
      incorporation of [3H]thymidine into thymidine triphosphate, and an increase in the 
      level of thymidine triphosphate, as well as a decrease in protein synthesis. In this 
      study, we have utilized a cycloheximide-resistant (Cycr) amoebic strain selected 
      from a population of cells mutagenized with nitrosoguanidine. Segregation data 
      indicate that the resistance is due to a single mutation. We have used this Cycr 
      mutant to construct Cycr plasmodial strains. Ribosomes isolated from such Cycr 
      plasmodia showed resistance to cycloheximide in vitro, in contrast to ribosomes 
      isolated from wild-type plasmodia. The Cycr plasmodia showed none of the 
      cycloheximide-induced biochemical effects. Plasmodia heterozygous for the resistance 
      marker were sensitive to cycloheximide with regard to growth but showed an 
      intermediate response in the biochemical parameters. Heterokaryons formed by fusion 
      of various proportions of the sensitive and resistant plasmodia showed a resistance 
      with regard to both growth and biochemical parameters which was directly related to 
      the fraction of Cycr plasmodia present in the heterokaryons. The data are consistent 
      with the hypothesis that the effects of cycloheximide on deoxyribonucleic acid 
      synthesis and nucleoside metabolism are secondary to the effect of the drug on 
      protein synthesis in this organism.

TI  - Control of chemotaxis in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 218-23
AB  - Plasmodia migrate towards those situations which increase the frequency of their 
      alternations in streaming, and away from those which decrease the frequency. 
      Therefore peristalsis-like waves in Physarum move in the direction opposite from the 
      net movement of the organism. The mechanism is fundamentally related to other known 
      types of chemotaxis.

TI  - Limited DNA synthesis in the absence of protein synthesis in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 577-83
AB  - Actidione (cycloheximide), an antibiotic inhibitor of protein synthesis, blocked the 
      incorporation of leucine and lysine during the S phase of Physarum polycephalum. 
      Actidione added during the early prophase period in which mitosis is blocked totally 
      inhibited the initiation of DNA synthesis. Actidione treatment in late prophase, 
      which permitted mitosis in the absence of protein synthesis, permitted initiation of 
      a round of DNA replication making up between 20 and 30% of the unreplicated nuclear 
      DNA. Actidione treatment during the S phase permitted a round of replication similar 
      to the effect at the beginning of S. The DNA synthesized in the presence of 
      actidione was replicated semiconservatively and was stable through at least the 
      mitosis following antibiotic removal. Experiments in which fluorodeoxyuridine 
      inhibition was followed by thymidine reversal in the presence of actidione suggest 
      that the early rounds of DNA replication must be completed before later rounds are 
      initiated.

TI  - Fragmin, a microfilament regulatory protein from Physarum polycephalum, is 
      phosphorylated by casein kinase II-type enzymes.
PG  - 5472-80
AB  - Fragmin is a 42 kDa regulatory protein involved in actin microfilament organization 
      in Physarum polycephalum. We show that fragmin is a target of casein kinase II (CK 
      II) enzymes isolated from evolutionarily divergent species. In Physarum 
      microplasmodia, two such kinases were identified. A serine residue located in the 
      sequence Gly-Gly-Ser-Asp-Leu-Glu constitutes the phosphorylation site and was 
      identified by phosphopeptide sequencing, mass spectometry analysis, and inhibition 
      studies with a synthetic peptide corresponding to this site. Interestingly, the 
      actin-fragmin dimer (A--F) as well as the actin2-fragmin trimer (A2--F) are equally 
      efficient targets, and phosphorylation had no effect on the actin-binding properties 
      of fragmin. Actin-fragmin isolated from microplasmodia revealed a minor acidic 
      fragmin isoform, suggesting that fragmin is phosphorylated in vivo. The 
      actin-fragmin complex is also phosphorylated on the actin subunit by an endogenous 
      actin-fragmin kinase [Gettemans, J., De Ville, Y., Vandekerckhove, J., & Waelkens, 
      E. (1992) EMBO J. 11, 3185-3191]. We show that the two phosphorylation events act 
      independently of each other.

TI  - The biosynthesis of plasmodial myosin during starvation of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 639-47
AB  - The actomyosin protein complex of Physarum polycephalum was prepared from vegetative 
      and starved plasmodia. The yield of actomyosin per unit wet wt. was the same from 
      both types of plasmodia. Myosin was resolved from the complex by gel filtration and 
      purified by ion-exchange chromatography. The Ca(2+)-stimulated adenosine 
      triphosphatase activities of myosin preparations from vegetative and starved 
      plasmodia were not appreciably different. Synthesis of myosin de novo was shown to 
      occur during the starvation phase of the life-cycle by the isolation of labelled 
      myosin preparations from plasmodia starved in the presence of [2-(14)C]glycine. 
      Fractionation of polyacrylamide gels after gel filtration of labelled myosin 
      confirmed the presence of label in the adenosine triphosphatase-active myosin band. 
      It is concluded that during starvation myosin synthesis continues although there is 
      a net loss of approx. 50% of the total protein. Sodium dodecyl 
      sulphate-polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis of Physarum myosin showed the presence 
      of low-molecular-weight components of the molecule, similar to those of muscle 
      myosins. The content and composition of the free amino acid pool of Physarum was 
      measured at various time-intervals during the vegetative and starvation phases of 
      the life-cycle.

TI  - A mobile group I intron in the nuclear rDNA of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 443-54
AB  - We have shown that a strain-specific group I intron (intron 3) in the nuclear 
      extrachromosomal rDNA or Physarum polycephalum is a mobile element. Shortly after 
      mating of amoebae from intron-lacking and intron-containing strains, intron 3 
      transposes in a site-specific manner into all available recipient molecules. The 
      transposition appears to occur by gene conversion, as evidence by the co-conversion 
      of adjacent sequences and by double strand breakage observed in some of the 
      recipient rDNA molecules. We infer that the double strand break is induced by an 
      endonuclease encoded by intron 3, since in vitro transcription and translation of 
      the cloned intron leads to the synthesis of an enzymatically active, site-specific 
      nuclease. This is the first demonstration of the transposition of a nuclear intron 
      in an experimental setting, and provides a rare example of a protein encoded by an 
      RNA polymerase I transcript.

TI  - Microtubule cytoskeleton and morphogenesis in the amoebae of the myxomycete Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 239-48
AB  - The amoebae of the myxomycete Physarum polycephalum are of interest in order to 
      analyze the morphogenesis of the microtubule and microfilament cytoskeleton during 
      cell cycle and flagellation. The amoebal interphase microtubule cytoskeleton 
      consists of 2 distinct levels of organization, which correspond to different 
      physiological roles. The first level is composed of the 2 kinetosomes or centrioles 
      and their associated structures. The anterior kinetosomes forming the anterior and 
      posterior flagella are morphologically distinguishable. Each centriole plays a role 
      in the morphogenesis of its associated satellites and specific microtubule arrays. 
      The 2 distinct centrioles correspond to the 2 successive maturation stages of the 
      pro-centrioles which are built during prophase. The second level of organization 
      consists of a prominent microtubule organizing center (mtoc 1) to which the anterior 
      centriole is attached at least during interphase. The mtoc plays a role in the 
      formation of the mitotic pole. These observations based on ultrastructural and 
      physiological analyses of the amoebal cytoskeleton are now being extended to the 
      biochemical level. The complex formed by the 2 centrioles and the mtoc 1 has been 
      purified without modifying the microtubule-nucleating activity of the mtoc 1. 
      Several microtubule-associated proteins have been characterized by their ability to 
      bind taxol-stabilized microtubules. Their functions (e.g., microtubule assembly, 
      protection of microtubules against dilution or cold treatment, phosphorylating and 
      ATPase activities) are under investigation. These biochemical approaches could allow 
      in vitro analysis of the morphogenesis of the amoebal microtubule cytoskeleton.

TI  - The poly(adenylic acid)-protein complex is restricted to the nonpolysomal messenger 
      ribonucleoprotein of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 1965-70
AB  - The distribution of poly(adenylic acid) [poly(A)]-protein complexes in the polysomal 
      and nonpolysomal messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) fractions of Physarum 
      polycephalum was examined in the present study. Poly-(A)-containing components 
      released from the nonpolysomal mRNP by ribonuclease (RNase) digestion were 
      quantitatively adsorbed to nitrocellulose filters at low ionic strength, were highly 
      resistant to micrococcal nuclease under conditions in which free poly(A) was 
      completely degraded, and sedimented as a 10-15S particle which was disrupted by 
      sodium dodecyl sulfate and protease treatment. These are characteristics of the 
      poly(A)-protein complex. In contrast,poly(A)-containing molecules released from the 
      polysomes by RNase were refractive to nitrocellulose, were completely sensitive to 
      micrococcal nuclease, and sedimented at 2-4 S, identical with the sedimentation 
      exhibited by protein-free poly(A). Examination of the poly(A) sequences present in 
      polysomal and nonpolysomal mRNP by polyacylamide gel electrophoresis showed that the 
      former contained only very short sequences, averaging approximately 15 nucleotides, 
      while the latter exhibited only much longer segments, averaging approximately 65 
      nucleotides. It is concluded that poly(A)-protein complexes are restricted to the 
      nonpolysomal mRNP of Physarum and that the limiting factor in complex formation may 
      be the length of the available poly(A) binding site.

TI  - High diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap4A) level at initiation of S phase in the 
      naturally synchronous mitotic cycle of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 171-7
AB  - Levels of the diadenosine tetraphosphate Ap4A are high during exponential growth of 
      Physarum, decrease during encystment (spherulation) and increase again during 
      excystment. Consistently, a rapid 8-30-fold increase in Ap4A level occurs at entry 
      into S phase of the mitotic cycle and is maintained during the first half of genome 
      replication. The elevated Ap4A level depends significantly on ongoing DNA 
      replication and is completely sensitive to the protein synthesis inhibitor 
      cycloheximide administered either before or after initiation of S phase.

TI  - Histone synthesis during the cell cycle of Physarum polycephalum. Synthesis of 
      different histone species is not under a common regulatory control.
PG  - 10195-9
AB  - The synthesis of histones and nonhistone nuclear proteins was studied during the 
      naturally synchronous cell cycle of Physarum polycephalum. Contrary to the commonly 
      accepted idea of a tight coupling of histone biosynthesis and DNA replication during 
      the somatic cell cycle we found that 40% of total histone synthesis takes place in 
      the G2 period in the complete absence of DNA synthesis. The core histones exhibit a 
      maximum of synthesis during S-phase. The synthesis of histones H2A and H2B continues 
      during the G2 period, but synthesis of H4 and H3 is restricted to the S-phase of the 
      cell cycle. Experiments with hydroxyurea demonstrated that the synthesis of H4 and 
      H3 is completely dependent on unperturbed DNA synthesis, whereas synthesis of H2A 
      and H2B is independent from DNA synthesis during the entire cell cycle. This 
      implicates significant differences between the arginine-rich histones H4 and H3 and 
      the moderately lysine-rich histones H2A and H2B with respect to the control 
      mechanisms of their synthesis, the metabolic stability, and the function for 
      chromatin structure. The nonhistone nuclear proteins are synthesized throughout the 
      cell cycle with a broad maximum in the early G2 period. The cell cycle pattern of 
      synthesis of H1 rather resembles the pattern of the nonhistone proteins than of core 
      histones.

TI  - The inhibitory Ca2+-regulation of the actin-activated Mg-ATPase activity of myosin 
      from Physarum polycephalum plasmodia.
PG  - 1433-46
AB  - Myosin was rapidly prepared from the slime mould, Physarum polycephalum to a high 
      level of homogeneity (greater than 95%), in a high yield (about 10 mg/100 g tissue) 
      and in a phosphorylated state (about 5 mol phosphate/mol of 500,000 Mr myosin). 
      Actin activated the Mg-ATPase activity of this myosin in the absence of Ca2+ about 
      30-fold, and this actin-activated ATPase activity was reduced to about 20% of the 
      original activity when Ca2+ concentration was increased to 50 microM, i.e., the 
      actin-myosin-ATP interactions show Ca-inhibition. The Ca2+ concentration giving 
      half-maximum inhibition was 1-3 microM. The Ca-inhibition was clearly observed at 
      physiological concentrations of Mg2+ but was obscured at both lower and higher 
      concentrations of Mg2+. The Ca-inhibitory effect on ATP hydrolysis by actomyosin 
      reconstituted from skeletal actin and Physarum myosin was quick and reversible. 
      Ca-binding measurement showed that myosin bound Ca2+ with half-maximal binding at 2 
      microM Ca2+ and maximum binding of 2 mol per mol myosin, indicating that Ca2+ may 
      inhibit the ATPase activity by binding to myosin. The involvement of this 
      myosin-linked regulatory system in the Ca2+ -control of cytoplasmic streaming is 
      discussed.

PG  - 365-73
AB  - Irradiation of the plasmodia of Physarum with blue and white light results in a 
      transient change of theie oscillatory contraction frequency. This reaction to light 
      decreases with increasing distance from the illuminated area (Block and 
      Wohlfarth-Bottermann, 1981). The first local appearance of light response in 
      non-illuminated parts of the plasmodia was used to analyse the sensory pathway of 
      the light stimulus modulating the contractile apparatus. Different experimental 
      assays revealed that the direction of photosensory transduction is determined by the 
      momentary direction of protoplasmic shuttle streaming. The endoplasmic flow carriers 
      the signal responsible for photosensory transduction and light reaction to the force 
      generating ectoplasmic tube.

TI  - Purification and partial characterization of transglutaminase from Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 2599-605
AB  - An intracellular form of calcium ion-dependent transglutaminase 
      (R-glutaminylpeptide:amine gamma-glutaminyltransferase, EC 2.3.2.13) was purified 
      818-fold to apparent homogeneity from acetone powder preparations of spherules of 
      the acellular slime mold Physarum polycephalum. The enzyme was purified by combined 
      methods of precipitation with 15% (wt/vol) polyethylene glycol, DEAE-cellulose 
      chromatography, and isoelectric focusing in a pH 5 to 7 gradient. The isoelectric 
      point of the enzyme was 6.1. The molecular mass of the denatured enzyme was 
      estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to be 39.6 
      kDa. A molecular weight of 77,000 was found by gel filtration of the native enzyme 
      on a Superose 12 fast protein liquid chromatography column, indicating that the 
      native functional protein is a dimer. The purified transglutaminase catalyzed the 
      incorporation of [14C]putrescine into protein substrates including casein, 
      N,N'-dimethylcasein, actin purified from P. polycephalum, and actin purified from 
      bovine muscle. Actin was the preferred substrate for the enzyme, both as a purified 
      protein and in crude extracts prepared from P. polycephalum. With 
      N,N'-dimethylcasein as the amine acceptor substrate, [14C]putrescine, 
      [14C]spermidine, and [14C]spermine were all effective amine donor substrates with Km 
      values of 49, 21.4, and 31.7 microM, respectively. All three of these polyamines 
      demonstrated strong substrate inhibition of the enzyme activity between 100 and 200 
      microM. Upon starvation induced by depletion of a carbon source for growth, the 
      specific activity of this enzyme increased sixfold during the differentiation of P. 
      polycephalum microplasmodia to spherules. This suggests a role for transglutaminase 
      in the construction of spherules, which have the capacity to survive starvation and 
      dessication.

TI  - A gene encoding the major beta tubulin of the mitotic spindle in Physarum 
      polycephalum plasmodia.
PG  - 1275-81
AB  - The multinucleate plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum is unusual among eucaryotic 
      cells in that it uses tubulins only in mitotic-spindle microtubules; cytoskeletal, 
      flagellar, and centriolar microtubules are absent in this cell type. We have 
      identified a beta-tubulin cDNA clone, beta 105, which is shown to correspond to the 
      transcript of the betC beta-tubulin locus and to encode beta 2 tubulin, the beta 
      tubulin expressed specifically in the plasmodium and used exclusively in the mitotic 
      spindle. Physarum amoebae utilize tubulins in the cytoskeleton, centrioles, and 
      flagella, in addition to the mitotic spindle. Sequence analysis shows that beta 2 
      tubulin is only 83% identical to the two beta tubulins expressed in amoebae. This 
      compares with 70 to 83% identity between Physarum beta 2 tubulin and the beta 
      tubulins of yeasts, fungi, alga, trypanosome, fruit fly, chicken, and mouse. On the 
      other hand, Physarum beta 2 tubulin is no more similar to, for example, Aspergillus 
      beta tubulins than it is to those of Drosophila melanogaster or mammals. Several 
      eucaryotes express at least one widely diverged beta tubulin as well as one or more 
      beta tubulins that conform more closely to a consensus beta-tubulin sequence. We 
      suggest that beta-tubulins diverge more when their expression pattern is restricted, 
      especially when this restriction results in their use in fewer functions. This 
      divergence among beta tubulins could have resulted through neutral drift. For 
      example, exclusive use of Physarum beta 2 tubulin in the spindle may have allowed 
      more amino acid substitutions than would be functionally tolerable in the beta 
      tubulins that are utilized in multiple microtubular organelles. Alternatively, 
      restricted use of beta tubulins may allow positive selection to operate more freely 
      to refine beta-tubulin function.

TI  - Retrotransposon-like nature of Tp1 elements: implications for the organisation of 
      highly repetitive, hypermethylated DNA in the genome of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 279-86
AB  - The repetitive fraction of the genome of the eukaryotic slime mould Physarum 
      polycephalum is dominated by the Tp1 family of highly repetitive 
      retrotransposon-like sequences. Tp1 elements consist of two terminal direct repeats 
      of 277bp which flank an internal domain of 8.3kb. They are the major sequence 
      component in the hypermethylated (M+) fraction of the genome where they have been 
      found exclusively in scrambled clusters of up to 50kb long. Scrambling is thought to 
      have arisen by insertion of Tp1 into further copies of the same sequence. In the 
      present study, sequence analysis of cloned Tp1 elements has revealed striking 
      homologies of the predicted amino acid sequence to several highly conserved domains 
      characteristic of retrotransposons. The relative order of the predicted coding 
      regions indicates that Tp1 elements are more closely related to copia and Ty than to 
      retroviruses. Self-integration and methylation of Tp1 elements may function to limit 
      transposition frequency. Such mechanisms provide a possible explanation for the 
      origin and organisation of M + DNA in the Physarum genome.

TI  - Regulation of tubulin synthesis during the cell cycle in the synchronous plasmodia 
      of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 120-8
AB  - Regulation of alpha- and beta-tubulin isotype synthesis during the cell cycle has 
      been studied in the myxomycete Physarum polycephalum, by subjecting synchronous 
      plasmodia to temperature shifts and pharmacological perturbations. Temperature 
      shifts interfered with the regulation of tubulin synthesis. Inhibition of DNA 
      synthesis prevents tubulin degradation after completion of the cell cycle (Ducommun 
      and Wright, Eur. J. Cell Biol., 50:48-55, 1989) but did not perturb the initiation 
      of tubulin synthesis. The constant increase of tubulin synthesis in the presence of 
      tubulin-sequestering drugs and the decrease of tubulin synthesis during a treatment 
      with aphidicolin in late G2 phase suggest the existence of an autoregulatory 
      mechanism of tubulin synthesis. Moreover, the microtubule poison methyl 
      benzimidazole carbamate dissociated synthesis of the alpha 1-tubulin isotype from 
      the generally strictly coordinated synthesis of all tubulin isotypes during the 
      transient interruption of mitosis. These observations show that a microtubular 
      poison can perturb regulation of the synthesis of specific isotubulins.

TI  - Location of a single beta-tubulin gene product in both cytoskeletal and 
      mitotic-spindle microtubules in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 623-8
AB  - In the mutant BEN210 of Physarum polycephalum several beta-tubulins are detectable. 
      beta 1-tubulin is unique to the myxamoeba, beta 2-tubulin is unique to the 
      plasmodium, and the mutant beta 1-210 tubulin encoded by the benD210 allele is 
      present in both cell types. In order to analyse the subcellular distribution of the 
      beta 1-210 polypeptide, we prepared cytoskeletons from myxamoebae and mitotic 
      spindles from plasmodia, and examined the tubulin polypeptide composition of these 
      microtubular organelles by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. 
      The results show that the beta 1-210 tubulin is present in microtubules of both the 
      cytoskeleton and the intranuclear mitotic spindle. Thus a single beta-tubulin gene 
      product can participate in multiple microtubular organelles in distinct cellular 
      compartments.

TI  - The effect of heat shock on the cell cycle regulation of tubulin expression in 
      Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 642-7
AB  - In the myxomycete Physarum polycephalum, tubulin synthesis is subject to mitotic 
      cycle control. Virtually all tubulin synthesis is limited to a 2-h period 
      immediately preceding mitosis, and the peak of tubulin protein synthesis is 
      accompanied by a parallel increase in the level of tubulin mRNA. The mechanism by 
      which the accumulation of tubulin mRNA is turned on and off is not clear. To probe 
      the relationship between tubulin regulation and cell cycle controls, we have used 
      heat shocks to delay mitosis and have followed the pattern of tubulin synthesis 
      during these delays. Two peaks of tubulin synthesis are observed after a heat shock. 
      One occurs at a time when synthesis would have occurred without a heat shock, and a 
      second peak immediately precedes the eventual delayed mitosis. These results are 
      clearly due to altered cell cycle regulation. No mitotic activity is detected in 
      delayed plasmodia at the time of the control mitosis, and tubulin behavior is shown 
      to be clearly distinct from that of heat shock proteins. We believe that the tubulin 
      family of proteins is subject to regulation by a thermolabile mitotic control 
      mechanism but that once the cell has been committed to a round of tubulin synthesis 
      the "tubulin clock" runs independently of the heat sensitive system. In delayed 
      plasmodia, the second peak of synthesis may be turned on by a repeat of the 
      commitment event.

TI  - Poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose) polymerase in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 119-29
AB  - 1. The isolated nuclei of the slime mould Physarum polycephalum contain an enzyme 
      that will incorporated [adenine-3H] NAD+ into an acid-insoluble product, which is 
      shown to be poly(ADP-ribose). 2. This incorporation has an optimum pH of 8.2 and a 
      temperature optimum below 10degreesC. 3. Optimum stimulation is given by 15 mM-Mg2+. 
      4. 2-Mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol also stimulates the incorporation, the latter 
      at an optimum concentration of about 1 mM. 5. Under optimum conditions the Km value 
      for the reaction is 0.28 mM at 15degreesC. Nicotinamide inhibits the incorporation 
      with a Ki of 5.7 muM. 6. Exogenous DNA stimulates the incorporation by about 100%. 
      7. Preincubation of the nuclei with deoxyribonuclease, but not with ribonuclease, 
      almost completely inactivates the incorporation of NAD+. 8. The enzyme is unstable 
      at both 0degrees and 15degreesC in the absence of dithiothreitol. The presence of 
      dithiothreitol at a concentration of 1 mM stabilizes the enzyme at both these 
      temperatures. 9. The activity of this enzyme per nucleus was shown in three separate 
      experiments to fall by about one-half in early S phase and then to rise to its 
      pre-mitotic value after about 3 h, that is in late S phase. 10. The possible 
      physiological function of this enzyme system is discussed.

TI  - Nucleoprotein chromatin subunit from Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 131-8
AB  - The nucleoproteins resulting from digestion of the nuclei of the true slime mold 
      Pysarum polycephalum with micrococcal nuclease have been resolved according to the 
      size classes in linear sucrose gradients containg 0.5 M NaCl, and analysed for DNA, 
      RNA and protein content. The basic nucleoprotein subunit has been found to contain a 
      DNA fragment of about 150--170 base pairs complexed with an approximately equal 
      amount, on a weight basis, of basic proteins and a relatively small amount of 
      non-histone proteins (about 35% of the amount of DNA). Higher nucleoprotein 
      oligomers were shown to contain spacer DNA fragments between adjacent subunits and a 
      considerably higher ratio of non-histone proteins to DNA than the basic subunit. 
      Both the basic subunit and higher nucleoprotein oligomers of Physarum chromatin 
      contain some amount of tightly bound RNA. However, in contrast to the distribution 
      of the non-histone proteins, the ratio of RNA to RNA is similar in both fractions.

TI  - Demonstration of cytoplasmic actomyosin fibrils by the freeze-etching technique.
PG  - 30-6
AB  - Cytoplasmic actomyosin fibrils of Physarum polycephalum were demonstrated by the 
      freeze-etching technique. Within the fibrils the electron micrographs reveal 40-80 A 
      thick filaments presumably representing F-actin. Thicker filaments (myosin) could 
      not be detected. To avoid freezing artefacts, a pretreatment of the living material 
      with 50% sucrose was necessary. The influence of freeze-protecting agents upon the 
      fine structure of cytoplasmic actomyosins and the resulting difficulties in the 
      investigation of constituents of the groundplasm with the freeze-etching technique 
      are discussed.

TI  - Separation of histones from Physarum polycephalum by ion-paired, reverse-phase 
      high-performance liquid chromatography.
PG  - 189-95
AB  - The histones of Physarum polycephalum were efficiently separated using a muBondapak 
      C-18 column with 50 mM triethylamine-phosphoric acid, pH 2.2, as the aqueous phase 
      and a gradient of increasing concentration of acetonitrile. The effects of buffer 
      concentration and changes in gradient rate and flow rate on retention times were 
      investigated to optimize separation. The recovery of total histones (70%) was 
      independent of loading up to at least 0.5 mg. Loading had little effect on retention 
      times. Under optimal conditions, substantially pure (less than 90%) fractions of 
      each histone were obtained. The quantity of each histone after HPLC fractionation 
      reflected its abundance in the original sample, indicating that there was no 
      selective loss of a particular histone.

      obvious changes observed after chemical stimulation proved to be cytokinetic 
      activities, ameboid-like movement phenomena, intense cell surface dynamics and 
      formation of cytoplasmic actin fibrils. The results demonstrate the high 
      adaptability of the microfilament system in Physarum even when subjected to extreme 
      conditions in the external environment.

TI  - Expression of a 66-kD heat shock protein associated with the process of cyst 
      formation of a true slime mold, Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 301-9
AB  - Under unfavorable conditions for growth, haploid myxoamoebae of Physarum 
      polycephalum retracted their pseudopodia and changed their cell shape into disk-like 
      form, after which they constructed the cell walls to form microcysts. These 
      morphological changes of haploid cells were associated with changes in intracellular 
      distribution of actin filaments. Staining with phalloidin showed that actin 
      filaments were almost uniformly distributed throughout the cytoplasm of the 
      myxoamoebae. When these cells were transferred to a cyst-inducing medium, the actin 
      structures changed into short rods or dots, after which the rods/dots disappeared in 
      the microcysts. An incubation of the myxoamoebae in the cyst-inducing medium caused 
      the synthesis of several proteins, among which a 66-kD protein was most prominently 
      induced. The morphological changes and the induction of the 66-kD protein was 
      pronounced at elevated temperatures, e.g. 40 degrees C. The 66-kD protein was not 
      induced, however, when plasmodia of the same species were incubated at 40 degrees C. 
      We found that the 66-kD protein was co-precipitated with polymerized actin and bound 
      to ATP-agarose. A double staining of the disk-shaped cells with anti-66-kD protein 
      antibody and phalloidin revealed superimposable localization of the 66-kD protein 
      and actin filaments in the short rods or dots. Although the induction of the 66-kD 
      protein was enhanced at high temperatures, the protein was immunologically unrelated 
      to the common heat shock proteins, HSP70 and HSP90, those are highly conserved 
      during evolution. These results indicate that the 66-kD protein is a novel heat 
      shock protein which is specifically expressed during cyst formation.

TI  - Isolation, characterisation and growth-related changes of an HMG-like protein from 
      microplasmodia of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 15-22
AB  - An alanine, lysine and glutamic acid-rich nuclear protein (P2) of Mr approximately 
      19,500 co-extracts with the histones from nuclei of Physarum polycephalum when using 
      the CaCl2 method for histone extraction [1] and was found to have the composition 
      previously ascribed to a putative histone H1(0) isolated from microplasmodia using 
      5% PCA (Yasuda, H., Mueller, R.D., Logan, K.A. and Bradbury, E.M. (1986) J. Biol. 
      Chem. 261, 2349-2354). P2 has very similar electrophoretic properties to chicken 
      erythrocyte histone H5, calf thymus histone H1(0) and the Physarum HMG-like protein 
      AS-2, but does not appear to be immunologically or structurally similar to H5 or 
      H1(0). An increase in the abundance of P2 was observed during exponential growth in 
      microplasmodia, reaching an approximately 1:1 ratio with histone H1 by 48 h of 
      culture. Standard amino acid analysis and NMR show that P2 is more HMG-like than 
      H1-like and CD measurements demonstrated that P2 contains only 5% secondary 
      structure in its maximally structured state and is, therefore, essentially 
      unstructured under in vivo conditions. Also possible clustering of acidic residues 
      is detected using CD and may be of functional significance. Analysis of 
      post-translational modification of P2 shows that it is phosphorylated at up to three 
      sites as isolated from immature spherules. The relationship of P2 to the HMG family 
      of proteins and AS-2 is discussed.

TI  - Phosphorylation of histidine in proteins by a nuclear extract of Physarum 
      polycephalum plasmodia.
PG  - 16106-13
AB  - A high salt nuclear extract from the true slime mold Physarum polycephalum was used 
      as a source of kinase activity for the incubation of calf thymus histones with 
      [gamma-32P]ATP. A major proportion of the 32P incorporated into histones was 
      acid-labile and alkali-stable. The nature of the alkali-stable phosphorylated 
      component was analyzed by subjecting the phosphorylated protein to total alkaline 
      hydrolysis and separating the resultant phosphoamino acids by anion exchange 
      chromatography. The 32P-labeled material co-chromatographed with phosphohistidine 
      standards and did not co-chromatograph with phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, or 
      phosphotyrosine standards. In similar experiments using reversed phase 
      high-performance liquid chromatography to separate the phosphoamino acids, the 
      32P-labeled phosphoamino acid behaved like the 1-isomer of phosphohistidine, in not 
      being retained by the column, and unlike 3-phosphohistidine, phosphoserine, 
      phosphothreonine, phosphotyrosine, and phosphoarginine, which were all retained on 
      the column. Histone H4 was a good substrate for the histidine kinase activity and 
      the location of the phosphorylated histidine residue was probed by peptide mapping 
      using chymotrypsin or V8 protease. Both maps were consistent with labeling of 
      histidine 75 and inconsistent with labeling of histidine 18. The data show that 
      Physarum nuclei contain a major kinase activity which produces phosphohistidine. The 
      methods we have developed for studying this kinase activity provide the basis for a 
      complete characterization of the structure and function of the Physarum enzyme and 
      can be applied to the study of similar kinase activities in other systems.

TI  - Plasmalemma invaginations of Physarum dependent on the nutritional content of the

PG  - 355-9
AB  - Quantitative estimates of plasmalemma invaginations in plasmodial veins of Physarum 
      polycephalum were made under different conditions of nutrition. Pronounced 
      differences were observed dependent on the nutritional content of the substrate. 
      There was a decided increase in the number of plasmalemma invaginations in 
      plasmodial veins grown on substrates containing absorbable food substances compared 
      to veins migrating on non-nutrient substrates. This observation supports the 
      proposition that the nutritional content, rather than the physical properties, of 
      the substrate is the decisive factor for the formation of plasmalemma invaginations. 
      The invaginations are believed to be concerned with the uptake of non-particulate 
      food substances.

AB  - Fluorescently labeled phallacidin, a F-actin specific drug, was used to demonstrate 
      the morphological variety in the cytoskeletal actin pattern of thin-spread plasmodia 
      of the acellular slime mould Physarum polycephalum. The patterns observed in 
      phallacidin-stained specimens consisted of a polygonal network in the anterior 
      region, and of longitudinal as well as helically twisted fibrils in plasmodial 
      strands of the posterior region. These observations are in complete accordance with 
      our recent results obtained on comparable plasmodia by immunofluorescence microscopy 
      using specific antibodies against actin.

TI  - Emission and biosynthesis of volatile terpenoids from the plasmodial slime mold 
      Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 2872-2880
LID - 10.3762/bjoc.15.281 [doi]
AB  - Terpene synthases (TPSs) are pivotal enzymes for the production of diverse terpenes, 
      including monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and diterpenes. In our recent studies, 
      dictyostelid social amoebae, also known as cellular slime molds, were found to 
      contain TPS genes for making volatile terpenes. For comparison, here we investigated 
      Physarum polycephalum, a plasmodial slime mold also known as acellular amoeba. 
      Plasmodia of P. polycephalum grown on agar plates were found to release a mixture of 
      volatile terpenoids consisting of four major sesquiterpenes (α-muurolene, 
      (E)-β-caryophyllene, two unidentified sesquiterpenoids) and the monoterpene 
      linalool. There were no qualitative differences in terpenoid composition at two 
      stages of young plasmodia. To understand terpene biosynthesis, we analyzed the 
      transcriptome and genome sequences of P. polycephalum and identified four TPS genes 
      designated PpolyTPS1-PpolyTPS4. They share 28-73% of sequence identities. 
      Full-length cDNAs for the four TPS genes were cloned and expressed in Escherichia 
      coli to produce recombinant proteins, which were tested for sesquiterpene synthase 
      and monoterpene synthase activities. While neither PpolyTPS2 nor PpolyTPS3 was 
      active, PpolyTPS1 and PpolyTPS4 were able to produce sesquiterpenes and monoterpenes 
      from the respective substrates farnesyl diphosphate and geranyl diphosphate. By 
      comparing the volatile profile of P. polycephalum plasmodia and the in vitro 
      products of PpolyTPS1 and PpolyTPS4, it was concluded that most sesquiterpenoids 
      emitted from P. polycephalum were attributed to PpolyTPS4. Phylogenetic analysis 
      placed the four PpolyTPSs genes into two groups: PpolyTPS1 and PpolyTPS4 being one 
      group that was clustered with the TPSs from the dictyostelid social amoeba and 
      PpolyTPS2 and PpolyTPS3 being the other group that showed closer relatedness to 
      bacterial TPSs. The biological role of the volatile terpenoids produced by the 
      plasmodia of P. polycephalum is discussed.

TI  - DNA synthesis by the isolated nuclear matrix from synchronized plasmodia of Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 254-63
AB  - Nuclear matrices were isolated from plasmodia of a true slime mold, Physarum 
      polycephalum, and the DNA synthetic activity in vitro was examined. These matrices 
      isolated in S-phase catalyzed DNA synthesis requiring Mg2+, deoxyribonucleoside 
      5'-triphosphates and ATP, without exogenous templates. The activity changed during 
      S-phase with the rate of in vivo DNA replication. Product analysis by gel 
      electrophoresis revealed that the matrices produced Okazaki fragments. These results 
      suggest that DNA synthesis partially reflects in vivo DNA replication. DNA synthesis 
      was sensitive to aphidicolin, heparin and N-ethylmaleimide, indicating involvement 
      of the alpha-like DNA polymerase of Physarum. Exogenous addition of activated DNA 
      stimulated DNA synthesis 4-10-fold and suggested that only some of the existing 
      enzymes are involved in endogenous DNA synthesis. Matrices isolated in G2-phase were 
      also associated with a similar DNA synthetic activity, but they did not produce 
      Okazaki fragments in vitro. It is, therefore, concluded that nuclear matrices are 
      associated with alpha-like DNA polymerase throughout the cell cycle, and that some 
      of the enzymes participate in in vivo DNA replication in S-phase; thus, DNA 
      replication is possibly controlled by this process. The relationship between DNA 
      synthetic activities by the isolated nuclei and matrices was also discussed.

TI  - A plasmodial alpha-tubulin cDNA from Physarum polycephalum. Nucleotide sequence and 
      comparative analysis.
PG  - 633-8
AB  - As the first step towards correlating structure and function of tubulin in the slime 
      mold Physarum polycephalum we have elucidated the nucleotide sequence of a cDNA that 
      appears to code for all but the last 25 to 30 C-terminal amino acids of a plasmodial 
      alpha-tubulin. Differences in amino acid sequence from those of other alpha-tubulins 
      are distributed fairly evenly throughout the sequence, although a relatively 
      extensive conserved region is found in position 396 to 426 near the C terminus. A 
      small region in position 298 to 307 contains a cluster of amino acid residues unique 
      to Physarum alpha-tubulin. The sequence is 70% homologous to two yeast 
      alpha-tubulins and about 83% homologous to five animal alpha-tubulins. A comparison 
      of the homologies of all the known alpha-tubulins indicates that a large decrease in 
      the accepted point mutation rate has occurred during the evolution of the metazoa, 
      suggesting a major functional specialization of microtubules.

TI  - Cyclic production of tension force in the plasmodial strand of Physarum polycephalum 
      and its relation to microfilament morphology.
PG  - 205-25
AB  - Cyclic contraction and relaxation of plasmodial strands of Physarum polycephalum 
      were measured under both isotonic and isometric conditions, and their relation to 
      changes in microfilament (MF) morphology was investigated. The 
      contraction-relaxation rhythm of a strand segment was insignificant and irregular 
      immediately after isolation from the mother plasmodium. It became regular half an 
      hour later when local minute rhythms were synchronized spontaneously. If a strand 
      kept under isotonic conditions was loaded with a heavier weight or a strand kept 
      under isometric conditions was stretched a few times, the amplitude of each 
      contraction wave was enhanced. After a strand had been thus conditioned, it was 
      fixed at a selected phase of the contraction-relaxation cycle under both isotonic 
      and isometric conditions. The state of MFs changed strikingly according to the phase 
      of the contraction cycle. In the shortening phase of the strand under isotonic 
      contractions, MFs with a diameter of 6--7 nm were arranged parallel to each other to 
      form large compact bundles in which adjacent filaments were bridged with cross 
      linkages. Among these MFs, thicker filaments were sporadically scattered. At about 
      the phase of minimal strand length, most of the MFs became kinky and formed 
      networks. In the elongating phase, new loose bundles of MFs developed from the 
      network. These loose bundles became compact again when the strand reached its 
      maximal elongation phase. In the isometric contraction, MFs in the increasing 
      tension phase were nearly the same as those in the shortening phase in isotonic 
      contraction. Around the maximal tension phase, dense areas of MFs appeared along the 
      bundles in place of the network formed in the isotonic contraction phase. These 
      areas were closely packed, with MFs arranged parallel to each other. In the 
      decreasing and minimal tension phases in isometric contraction, MFs were arranged 
      similarly to those in the elongating and maximally elongated phases, respectively, 
      in isotonic contraction. Alternation between the straight bundle and fine network 
      configuration of the MFs observed in isotonic contraction was inconspicuous in 
      isometric contraction. This was probably due to spatial restriction of shortening 
      under isometric contraction. The results are interpreted in terms of cyclic changes 
      of the aggregation pattern of the MFs in the form of F-actin, as opposed to the 
      possibility that the contraction-relaxation cycles depend on cyclic G-F 
      transformation of actin.

      by electroporation or CaCl2 treatment. In both cases significant transient levels of 
      CAT gene expression were detected. Results were compared with those obtained with 
      plasmids in which CAT gene expression was driven by eukaryotic virus promoters.

TI  - Characterization of a telomere-binding protein from Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 2282-90
AB  - We have partially purified a nuclear protein (PPT) from Physarum polycephalum that 
      binds to the extrachromosomal ribosomal DNA telomeres of this acellular slime mold. 
      Binding is specific for the (T2AG3)n telomere repeats, as evidenced by 
      nitrocellulose filter binding assays, by gel mobility shift assays with both DNA 
      fragments and double-stranded oligonucleotides, and by DNase I footprinting. PPT is 
      remarkably heat stable, showing undiminished binding activity after incubation at 90 
      degrees C. It sediments at 1.2S, corresponding to a molecular weight of about 10,000 
      (for a globular protein), and its binding activity is undiminished by incubation 
      with RNase, suggesting that it is not a ribonucleoprotein. We hypothesize that PPT 
      plays a structural role in telomeres, perhaps preventing nucleolytic degradation or 
      promoting telomere extension by a telomere-specific terminal transferase.

TI  - Patterns of histone acetylation in Physarum polycephalum. H2A and H2B acetylation is 
      functionally distinct from H3 and H4 acetylation.
PG  - 329-35
AB  - Histone acetylation has previously been correlated with both chromosome replication 
      and transcription. We present evidence that (a) confirms both correlations in the 
      true slime mold, Physarum polycephalum and (b) shows that quite a different pattern 
      of acetate turnover is associated with replication compared with transcription. The 
      pattern associated with replication involves turnover of acetate on all four core 
      histones on species containing one or two acetates per molecule. This pattern was 
      resolved from the transcription-associated pattern by three different procedures: 
      (a) detailed analysis of gels of histones pulse-labelled with acetate; (b) the 
      pattern of acetylation of histones pulse-labelled with [3H]lysine; and (c) the 
      pattern of acetylation of soluble histones. The pattern associated with 
      transcription is restricted to histones H3 and H4 and occurs mostly on highly 
      acetylated species. This pattern was resolved by (a) analysis of gels of histones 
      pulse-labelled with acetate; (b) the pattern of histone acetylation in G2 phase of 
      the cell cycle; and (c) the pattern of histone acetylation in the presence of 
      cycloheximide.

AB  - Thymidine (TK) and deoxycytidine (dCK) kinase levels, chromosome counts and whole

      polycephalum--TU84 and TU63--and on several wild type (wt) plasmodial and amoebal 
      strains from Wis 1 and Colonia backgrounds. It was found that (a) dCK levels and 
      protein:DNA ratios were similar in all plasmodia, regardless of ploidy or genetic 
      background; (b) TU84 and 63 were haploid; (c) TK specific activity was similar in 
      all wt plasmodia but lower in amoebae; (d) TK activities of mutants and wt were 
      approximately additive in heterokaryons. It was concluded that TK deficiency is due 
      to a defect in a structural gene and that wt strains are TK+/TK+ and mutants 
      hemizygous TK-.

AB  - Small plasmodial fragments derived from the acellular slime mold Physarum 
      polycephalum were used to demonstrate a functional relationship between 
      ultrastructural changes of the membrane-cytoskeleton complex and rhythmic activities 
      of the motive force generating system. During contraction the microfilament layer 
      detaches from the plasma membrane and moves inwards thus causing syneresis of 
      central granuloplasm from peripheral hyaloplasm. Simultaneously, on the internal 
      face of the plasma membrane a more or less regular two-dimensional network of short 
      filaments and small particles becomes visible resembling the spectrin membrane 
      skeleton of erythrocytes. With incipient relaxation the contracted microfilament 
      system disintegrates and a new layer is formed at the internal cell surface. 
      Biochemical studies on isolated plasma membranes by gel-electrophoresis revealed 
      three distinct bands of 29, 38 and 40 kD as well as some other conspicuous 
      polypeptides such as actin, myosin and, especially, a high molecular weight 
      actin-binding protein (HABP) of 230 kD. Moreover, a 22 kD component was recognized 
      as an integral membrane glycoprotein by Triton X-114 extraction and Con A-peroxidase 
      staining. It is discussed whether the 230 kD and 22 kD proteins are comparable to 
      spectrin and the actin-binding protein ponticulin from Dictyostelium, respectively.

TI  - A Gene, ALCA, Affecting the Life Cycle Form Expressed in PHYSARUM POLYCEPHALUM.
PG  - 35-55
AB  - The usual sequence of forms in the Physarum polycephalum life cycle is 
      plasmodium-spore-amoeba-plasmodium. So-called "amoebaless life cycle" or alc mutants 
      of this Myxomycete undergo a simplified plasmodium-spore-plasmodium life cycle. We 
      have analyzed three independently isolated alc mutants and found in each case that 
      the failure of the spores to give rise to amoebae is due to a recessive Mendelian 
      allele. The three mutations are tightly linked to one another and belong to a single 
      complementation group, alcA. The mutations are pleiotropic, not only interfering 
      with the establishment of the amoebal form at spore germination, but also affecting 
      the phenotype of alc amoebae, which occasionally arise from alc spores. The alc 
      amoebae (1) grow more slowly than wild type, particularly at elevated temperatures; 
      (2) tend to transform directly into plasmodia, circumventing the sexual fusion of 
      amoebae that usually accompanies plasmodium formation; and (3) form plasmodia by the 
      sexual mechanism less efficiently than wild-type amoebae. The various effects of an 
      alc mutation seem to derive from mutation of a single gene, since reversion for one 
      effect is always accompanied by reversion for the other effects. Moreover, a 
      mutation, aptA1, that blocks direct plasmodium formation by alcA amoebae, also 
      increases their growth rate to near normal. The manner of plasmodium formation in 
      alcA strains differs significantly from that in another class of mutants, the gad 
      mutants. Unlike gad amoebae, alcA amoebae need not reach a critical density in order 
      to differentiate directly into plasmodia and do not respond to the extracellular 
      inducer of differentiation. In addition, alcA differentiation is not prevented by a 
      mutation, npfA1, that blocks direct differentiation by most gad amoebae.

TI  - Two Multiallelic Mating Compatibility Loci Separately Regulate Zygote Formation and 
      Zygote Differentiation in the Myxomycete PHYSARUM POLYCEPHALUM.
PG  - 513-30
AB  - The mating of Physarum polycephalum amoebae, the ultimate consequence of which is a 
      "plasmodium," was recently shown to be governed by two compatibility loci, matA (or 
      mt) and matB (Dee 1978; Youngmanet al. 1979). We present evidence that matA and matB 
      separately regulate two discrete stages of mating: in the first stage, amoebae 
      (which are normally haploid) fuse in pairs, with a specificity determined by matB 
      genotype, to form diploid zygotes; subsequent differentiation of the zygotes into 
      plasmodia is regulated by matA and is unaffected by matB. Mixtures of amoebae 
      carrying unlike matA and matB alleles formed diploids to the extent of 10 to 15% of 
      the cells present, and the diploids differentiated into plasmodia. When only the 
      matB alleles differed, diploid cells still formed to a comparable (5 to 10%) extent, 
      but rather than differentiating, these diploids remained amoebae. When strains 
      carried the same alleles of matB, formation of diploid cells was greatly reduced: in 
      like-matB, like-matA mixtures, none of 320 cells examined was diploid; in like-matB, 
      unlike mat-A mixtures, differentiating diploids could be detected, but at only 
      10(-3) to 10(-2) the frequency of unlike-matB, unlike-matA mixtures. The 
      nondifferentiating diploid amoebae recovered from unlike-matB, like-matA mixtures 
      were genetically stable through extensive growth, even though they grew more slowly 
      than haploids (10-hr vs. 8-hr doubling period), and could be crossed with both 
      haploids and diploids. The results of such higher ploidy and mixed ploidy crosses 
      indicate that karyogamy does not invariably accompany zygote formation and 
      differentiation.

PG  - 34-40
AB  - The effects of the microtubule-disrupting drugs, colchicine, vinblastine, 
      podophyllotoxin, griseofulvin, and lumicolchicine (10(-5) M), on protein and RNA 
      synthesis were studied in Physarum polycephalum amoebae in culture. All, except 
      lumicolchicine, were found to simultaneously reduce the rate of protein synthesis 
      and stimulate RNA synthesis. These results parallel the effects seen in cells 
      exposed to heat shock. Treatment of cells with a microfilament-disrupting drug, 
      cytochalasin B (10 micrograms/ml in ethanol), resulted in a reduced rate of protein 
      synthesis after 2 h compared to a similar effect by vinblastine in 5--15 min. A 
      morphological abnormality, microtubule paracrystals, were seen associated with 
      centrioles in vinblastine-treated cells in which protein synthesis had been reduced 
      by 50%. Vinblastine and podophyllotoxin were shown to interfere with the recovery of 
      protein synthesis after inhibition by low or elevated temperatures. The possible 
      role of microtubules in regulating the translational response of a cell to an 
      external environmental stimulus is discussed.

PG  - 6129-33
AB  - The substrate specificity of diadenosine 5',5"'-P1,P4-tetraphosphate 
      pyrophosphohydrolase from Physarum polycephalum for dinucleoside polyphosphates has 
      been determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HP-LC). Elution of a 
      strong anion-exchange resin with a pH and ionic strength gradient of ammonium 
      phosphate separates a series of monoadenosine and diadenosine polyphosphates. Most 
      of the corresponding guanine nucleotides are also resolved on this HPLC system. One 
      mole each of Ap4A and Gp4G is symmetrically hydrolyzed to 2 mol of ADP and GDP, 
      respectively. Ap3A, Ap5A, Ap6A, and Ap4 are hydrolyzed, and in each case ADP is one 
      of the products. Gp3G, Gp5G, Gp6G, and Gp4 are also substrates, and in each case GDP 
      is one of the products. AMP, ADP, ATP, Ap2A, ADPR, GMP, GDP, GTP, NAD+, and NADP+ 
      are not substrates. No hydrolysis of the cap dinucleotides m7Gp3Am and m7Gp3Cm was 
      detected by HPLC. Diadenosine tetraphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase preparations were 
      also assayed for adenylate kinase, nucleotide diphosphate kinase, NAD(P)+ 
      pyrophosphohydrolase, phosphodiesterase, cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, 
      phosphatase, and ribonuclease activities. These enzymic activities were not 
      detectable in diadenosine tetraphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase. The symmetrical 
      hydrolysis of Ap4A and Gp4G is an unique catalytic property that distinguishes 
      diadenosine tetraphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase from P. polycephalum from 
      diadenosine tetraphosphate phosphohydrolases from other organisms.

TI  - DNA replication in homogenates of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 459-70
AB  - Homogenates of Physarum polycephalum incorporate [3H]dATP into nuclear DNA at an 
      initial rate of approximately 15% of the in vivo rate. To attain this level of 
      synthesis, cultures, are homogenized in a medium containing Mg++, EGTA, glucose and 
      spermine. Incorporation is strongly stimulated by the addition of ATP and all four 
      deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates to homogenates prior to incubation. Various 
      inorganic cations other than Mg++ either do not affect synthesis or are inhibitory. 
      Incorporation is inhibited by a nonionic detergent, Triton X-100. DNA synthesis in 
      this cell-free nuclear system is similar in several respects to that which occurs in 
      vivo: (1) The rate of DNA synthesis in the intact organism at a given time in the 
      mitotic cycle is reflected by the level of synthesis in homogenates prepared from 
      cultures at that time of the cycle; (2) DNA strands labeled in vitro exhibit 
      alkaline sucrose density gradient sedimentation properties similar to those of 
      daughter-strand DNA pulse-labeled in vivo; and (3) Homogenates of cultures which 
      were pre-treated with cycloheximide incorporate [3H]dATP at about 60% of the level 
      observed in homogenates of untreated controls.

TI  - A calcium ion-dependent atp pyrophosphohydrolase in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 207-19
AB  - An activity of ATP Pyrophosphohydrolase (EC 3.6.1.8) was found in the soluble 
      fraction of the plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum. The products of the enzyme 
      reaction were inorganic pyrophosphate and 5'-AMP in equimolar quantities. The enzyme 
      had a pronounced requirement for Ca2+ with high specificity. Mg-2+ was not an 
      essential cofactor but stimulated the enzyme activity about 2.5-fold of the control. 
      The enzyme hydrolyzed ITP, GTP and beta,gamma-methylene ATP at a limited rate. Among 
      inhibitors tested, 3 mM caffeine reduced the activity to about 75% of the control. 
      The enzyme had a broad pH optimum around pH=7.0 and the Km for ATP was 2.0 mM. An 
      Arrhenius plot showed a break at about 18 degrees C and the calculated activation 
      energies were 6.7 and 11.4 kcal/mol above and below the transition temperature, 
      respectively. Disc electrophoresis in dodecyl sulfate and gel filtration on Sephadex 
      -g-200 gave apparent molecular weights of 56 000 and 240 000, respectively, 
      suggesting that the native enzyme was built up from 4 polypeptide chains. The 
      possible role of the enzyme in vivo was discussed.

TI  - Periodic synthesis of microtubular proteins in the cell cycle of Physarum.
PG  - 5000-4
AB  - Periodic polypeptide labeling over the naturally synchronous nuclear replication 
      cycle of Physarum polycephalum was analyzed by fluorography of two-dimensional 
      electropherograms. Two sets of polypeptides, denoted as P and Q, showed strong 
      periodicity; they were maximally labeled just prior to mitosis. This periodicity was 
      shown to reflect synthesis rather than turnover or recovery. Both P and Q 
      copolymerized with porcine microtubular proteins and displayed electrophoretic 
      properties similar to those of porcine tubulins. The significance of the periodic 
      synthesis of these microtubular proteins is discussed as a possible component within 
      the chain of events that establishes the high mitotic synchrony of Physarum 
      syncytia.

TI  - Variable pathways for developmental changes of mitosis and cytokinesis in Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 591-604
AB  - The development of a uninucleate ameba into a multinucleate, syncytial plasmodium in 
      myxomycetes involves a change from the open, astral mitosis of the ameba to the 
      intranuclear, anastral mitosis of the plasmodium, and the omission of cytokinesis 
      from the cell cycle. We describe immunofluorescence microscopic studies of the 
      amebal-plasmodial transition (APT) in Physarum polycephalum. We demonstrate that the 
      reorganization of mitotic spindles commences in uninucleate cells after commitment 
      to plasmodium formation, is completed by the binucleate stage, and occurs via 
      different routes in individual developing cells. Most uninucleate developing cells 
      formed mitotic spindles characteristic either of amebae or of plasmodia. However, 
      chimeric mitotic figures exhibiting features of both amebal and plasmodial mitoses, 
      and a novel star microtubular array were also observed. The loss of the 
      ameba-specific alpha 3-tubulin and the accumulation of the plasmodium-specific beta 
      2-tubulin isotypes during development were not sufficient to explain the changes in 
      the organization of mitotic spindles. The majority of uninucleate developing cells 
      undergoing astral mitoses (amebal and chimeric) exhibited cytokinetic furrows, 
      whereas cells with the anastral plasmodial mitosis exhibited no furrows. Thus, the 
      transition from astral to anastral mitosis during the APT could be sufficient for 
      the omission of cytokinesis from the cell cycle. However, astral mitosis may not 
      ensure cytokinesis: some cells undergoing amebal or chimeric mitosis contained 
      unilateral cytokinetic furrows or no furrow at all. These cells would, most 
      probably, fail to divide. We suggest that a uninucleate committed cell undergoing 
      amebal or chimeric mitosis can either divide or else form a binucleate cell. In 
      contrast, a uninucleate cell with a mitotic spindle of the plasmodial type gives 
      rise only to a binucleate cells. Further, the decision to enter mitosis after 
      commitment to the APT is independent of the developmental changes in the 
      organization of the mitotic spindle and cytokinesis.

TI  - Usage of the H3 variants during the S-phase of the cell cycle in Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 2536-2548
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkac060 [doi]
AB  - DNA replication occurring in S-phase is critical for the maintenance of the cell 
      fate from one generation to the next, and requires the duplication of epigenetic 
      information. The integrity of the epigenome is, in part, insured by the recycling of 
      parental histones and de novo deposition of newly synthesized histones. While the 
      histone variants have revealed important functions in epigenetic regulations, the 
      deposition in chromatin during S-phase of newly synthesized histone variants remains 
      unclear. The identification of histone variants of H3 and unique features of 
      Physarum polycephalum provides a powerful system for investigating de novo 
      deposition of newly synthesized histones by tracking the incorporation of exogenous 
      histones within cells. The analyses revealed that the rate of deposition of H3.1 and 
      H3.3 is anticorrelated as S-phase progresses, H3.3 is predominately produced and 
      utilized in early S and dropped throughout S-phase, while H3.1 behaved in the 
      opposite way. Disturbing the expression of H3 variants by siRNAs revealed mutual 
      compensation of histone transcripts. Interestingly, the incorporation of pre-formed 
      constrained histone complexes showed that tetramers of H3/H4 are more efficiently 
      utilized by the cell than dimers. These results support the model whereby the 
      histone variant distribution is established upon replication and new histone 
      deposition.

PG  - 2291-3
AB  - In Physarum polycephalum, histone mRNA begins to accumulate 3 h before the S phase. 
      We show that histone synthesis was limited to the S phase and that the mRNA that 
      accumulated in the G2-phase cytoplasm could be translated in vitro. Thus, 
      recruitment of stored mature histone mRNA did not occur until the S phase began.

TI  - RNA editing by cytidine insertion in mitochondria of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 434-8
AB  - A corollary of the central dogma of molecular biology is that genetic information 
      passes from DNA to RNA by the continuous synthesis of RNA on a DNA template. The 
      demonstration of RNA editing (the specific insertion, deletion or substitution of 
      residues in RNA to create an RNA with a sequence different from its own template) 
      raised the possibility that in some cases not all of the genetic information for a 
      trait residues in the DNA template. Two different types of RNA editing have been 
      identified in mitochondria: insertional editing represented by the extensive 
      insertion (and occasional deletion) of uridine residues in mitochondrial RNAs of the 
      kinetoplastid protozoa and the substitutional editing represented by the cytidine to 
      uridine substitutions in some plant mitochondria. These editing types have not been 
      shown to be present in the same organism and may have very different mechanisms. RNA 
      editing of both types has been observed in nonmitochondrial systems but is not as 
      extensive and may involve still different mechanisms. Here we report the discovery 
      of extensive insertional RNA editing in mitochondria from an organism other than a 
      kinetoplastid protozoan. The mitochondrial RNA apparently encoding the alpha subunit 
      of ATP synthetase in the acellular slime mould, Physarum polycephalum, is edited at 
      54 sites by cytidine insertion.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Drug repositioning can reduce the time, costs and risks of drug 
      development by identifying new therapeutic effects for known drugs. It is 
      challenging to reposition drugs as pharmacological data is large and complex. 
      Subnetwork identification has already been used to simplify the visualization and 
      interpretation of biological data, but it has not been applied to drug repositioning 
      so far. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing a new Physarum-inspired 
      Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree algorithm to identify subnetworks for drug 
      repositioning. RESULTS: Drug Similarity Networks (DSN) are generated using the 
      chemical, therapeutic, protein, and phenotype features of drugs. In DSNs, vertex 
      prizes and edge costs represent the similarities and dissimilarities between drugs 
      respectively, and terminals represent drugs in the cardiovascular class, as defined 
      in the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system. A new 
      Physarum-inspired Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree algorithm is proposed in this paper 
      to identify subnetworks. We apply both the proposed algorithm and the widely-used GW 
      algorithm to identify subnetworks in our 18 generated DSNs. In these DSNs, our 
      proposed algorithm identifies subnetworks with an average Rand Index of 81.1%, while 
      the GW algorithm can only identify subnetworks with an average Rand Index of 64.1%. 
      We select 9 subnetworks with high Rand Index to find drug repositioning 
      opportunities. 10 frequently occurring drugs in these subnetworks are identified as 
      candidates to be repositioned for cardiovascular diseases. CONCLUSIONS: We find 
      evidence to support previous discoveries that nitroglycerin, theophylline and 
      acarbose may be able to be repositioned for cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, we 
      identify seven previously unknown drug candidates that also may interact with the 
      biological cardiovascular system. These discoveries show our proposed 
      Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree approach as a promising strategy for drug 
      repositioning.

TI  - Can't see the colony for the bees: behavioural perspectives of biological 
      individuality.
PG  - 1935-1946
LID - 10.1111/brv.12542 [doi]
AB  - The question 'what is an individual' does not often arise in studies within the 
      field of behavioural ecology. Generally behavioural ecologists do not think about 
      what makes an individual because they tend to use intuitive working concepts of 
      individuality. Rarely do they explicitly mention how individuality affects their 
      experimental design and interpretation of results. By contrast, the concept of 
      individuality continues to intrigue philosophers of biology. It is interesting that 
      while philosophers of biology debate definitions of individuality, biologists 
      generally use the concept of individuality every day without much thought. Here we 
      review the philosophical approaches to defining biological individuality, and 
      illustrate how the biological individuality concepts used by biologists are affected 
      by their study question and choice of organism. We clarify the behavioural 
      perspective of biological individuality by introducing the concept of the 
      behavioural individual. The notion of the behavioural individual is particularly 
      interesting when explored in less-conventional study organisms. By including 
      less-conventional organisms, it becomes clear why the concept of biological 
      individuality is usually intuitive in behavioural ecology.

TI  - Structure of three-dimensionally rod-shaped mitochondrial nucleoids isolated from 
      the slime mould Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 241-61
AB  - Mitochondrial nucleoids were isolated from microplasmodia of the true slime mould 
      Physarum polycephalum using a discontinuous sucrose gradient following treatment of 
      the mitochondria with Nonidet P-40. Studies of the isolated mitochondrial nucleoids 
      by fluorescence and electron microscopy showed that the isolated structure was 
      morphologically intact when compared with the structure in the mitochondria. 
      Scanning and negative staining electron micrographs of the isolated mitochondrial 
      nucleoids indicated the presence of 'elemental fibres', 10 nm in diameter, which 
      were organized three-dimensionally into the rod-shaped structure of the nucleoid. 
      Increases in ionic strength brought about loss of shape of the nucleoids and the 
      elementary fibres became bare in places, from which thin filaments, believed to be 
      DNA, protruded. After treatment of the isolated nucleoid with Pronase E, the 
      three-dimensional shape was lost and a large number of DNA filaments appeared to 
      radiate from the undigested region of the remaining nucleoid. Biochemical analyses 
      of the isolated nucleoids revealed that the ratio of A235 to A260 was 0.7 while 
      RNA:DNA and protein:DNA were 0.4 and 1.4, respectively. Sodium dodecyl 
      sulphate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the isolated nucleoids indicated that 
      polypeptides of molecular weight 20 K, 32 K, 34 K, 39 K, 41 K, 65 K, 66 K, 96 K and 
      125 K were associated specifically with the nucleoids.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of diadenosine 5',5"'-P1,P4-tetraphosphate 
      pyrophosphohydrolase from Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 6123-8
AB  - A new enzyme that hydrolyzes diadenosine 5',5"'-P1,P4-tetraphosphate has been 
      purified by a factor of 250 from the acellular slime mold Physarum polycephalum. 
      Activity was assayed radioisotopically with [3H]Ap4A. Isolation of the enzyme was 
      facilitated by dye-ligand chromatography. The enzyme symmetrically hydrolyzes Ap4A 
      to ADP and exhibits biphasic kinetics for the substrate with values for the apparent 
      Km of 2.6 micro M and 37 micro M. The two values of Vmax differ by a factor of 10. 
      Mg2+, Ca2+, and other divalent cations inhibit the activity with 40-80% inhibition 
      occurring at 0.5 mM. Mg2+, at 0.5 mM, decreases both values of Vmax by 50%, 
      decreases the low Km value by about 30%, and increases the high Km value by about 
      100%. (Ethylenedinitrilo)tetraacetic acid (EDTA) and 
      [ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid (EGTA), at 10 mM, inhibit the 
      activity by 50%. ADP, ATP, Ap4, and Gp4 are equipotent inhibitors with 50% 
      inhibition occurring at 30 micro M. AMP is a relatively weak inhibitor. The 
      molecular weight of the enzyme is 26000 on the basis of elution of activity from a 
      calibrated Sephadex G-75 column.

TI  - Contraction rhythm in the plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum: dependence of the 
      period on the amplitude, temperature and chemical environment.
PG  - 37-42
AB  - The plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum exhibits a characteristic protoplasmic 
      shuttle streaming and generates periodical tension. We determined the factors which 
      govern the period of the contraction rhythm by measuring isometric tension of the 
      plasmodial strand and the motive force of the protoplasmic streaming under a variety 
      of conditions by changing the size of plasmodia, chemical composition of environment 
      and surrounding temperatures. The results are: (1) The period of contraction rhythm, 
      tau, increased linearly with the amplitude of oscillating tension, F, and was 
      expressed by the following empirical equation when F was lower than a certain 
      critical value, Fc, i.e., tau = aF+tau O. Above Fc, tau stayed at a constant level 
      of tau S. There, a tau O and tau S are numerical constants which are independent of 
      F. A similar relationship is valid for the amplitude of the motive force of the 
      protoplasmic streaming, delta P. (2) Values of tau O were 1.0 min in air and 1.6 min 
      in an aqueous medium and they were independent of temperature. (3) The Arrhenius 
      plots of the parameter "a" exhibited different straight lines in air and in aqueous 
      medium, from which the values of Q10 were determined to be 4.0 and 10, respectively. 
      (4) Lowering of temperature decreased Fc, and eventually diminished it at Tc (= 15 
      degrees C). (5) The presence of glucose, CaCl2, MgCl2 and NaCl gave the identical 
      tau-F relationship. Applications od D2O and ethanol slowed down the contraction 
      rhythm, while that of KCl accelerated the rhythm. However, all these chemicals did 
      not affect the tau O value. All results described above indicate that the 
      contraction rhythm in the plasmodium is influenced by three components: a limit 
      cycle which is independent of tension generation, a component which is strongly 
      linked to the amplitude of the tension, F, and the part which is independent of the 
      value of F. External factors appear to influence separately these three components 
      of the contraction rhythm.

TI  - Multiple forms of actin in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 169-75
AB  - Actin in the acellular slime mold Physarum polycephalum consists of three major 
      forms closely spaced at isoelectric point (IP) 4.7 and a minor form at IP 5.1. Amino 
      acid analysis has shown the IP 5.1 actin to be nearly identical to the 4.7 actins. 
      In actin purified from acetone powder, both actin forms were present. Both forms 
      bound to DNase I and have the same molecular weight of about 43 000 on sodium 
      dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gels. On 2-D gels of nuclear proteins, both 
      forms of actin were present. The IP 4.7 actins account for 8.6% of total plasmodial 
      protein, and the IP 5.1 form for about 0.7%. In the nucleus the IP 4.7 actins 
      comprise 2.7% of total nuclear protein, and the 5.1 actin about 0.4%. No cell 
      cycle-associated change in the concentration of actins was observed in either total 
      plasmodial extracts or in isolated nuclei. Pulse-labelling experiments have shown 
      that in total plasmodia actin synthesis occurs throughout the cell cycle, with no 
      relative changes in the rate of synthesis. In isolated nuclei labelled during 
      mitosis and early S-phase, there is about twice as much labelled actin as in nuclei 
      labelled prior to mitosis. This result may indicate an increase in the transport of 
      actin into the nucleus.

PG  - 1174-7
AB  - Two RNA polymerases have been purified from the slime mold Physarum polycephalum, 
      one sensitive and one resistant to alpha-amanitin. Both enzymes are more active with 
      denatured DNA than native DNA as a template and prefer Mn(++) rather than Mg(++) as 
      a divalent cation. The alpha-amanitin-sensitive enzyme shows maximum activity at 
      0.15 M KCl, whereas the resistant enzyme is most active at very low ionic strength. 
      Analysis of the resistant enzyme on polyacrylamide gels containing sodium dodecyl 
      sulfate shows two subunits present in a 1:1 ratio with molecular weights of 205,000 
      and 125,000.

PG  - 1097-102
AB  - Directed migration by a cell is a good phenomenon for studying intracellular 
      coordination. Dynamic organization of both ATP and birefringent fibrils throughout 
      the cell was studied in the multinuclear ameboid cell of the Physarum plasmodium 
      during free locomotion and galvanotaxis. In a directionally migrating plasmodium, 
      waves of ATP as well as thickness oscillations propagated from just inside the 
      advancing front to the rear, and ATP concentration was high at the front on the 
      average. In a DC electric field, locomotion was inhibited more strongly, ATP 
      concentration decreased more, and birefringent fibrils were formed more abundantly 
      at the anodal than at the cathodal side. Inside the cell there were a few 
      undulations in the distributions of ATP and birefringent fibrils. In short, 
      birefringent fibrils become abundant where ATP concentration decreases. The possible 
      mechanism of the coordination in the directed migration and the implications of the 
      scaling law are discussed.

TI  - Newly-initiated DNA isolated from Physarum in early S phase consists of 
      nascent-nascent duplexes.
PG  - 394-401
AB  - We have studied the nature of newly initiated DNA released during DNA isolation at 
      the beginning of S phase of Physarum polycephalum. The released DNA was separated 
      from the bulk DNA by sedimentation through sucrose gradients. Gentle shearing 
      strongly enhanced the release of newly initiated DNA. The additionally released 
      material had a larger average molecular weight. Buoyant density analysis after 
      labelling with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) revealed that the released DNA consisted of 
      nascent-nascent duplexes for more than 90%. This indicates that the release of newly 
      initiated DNA occurs by branch migration. We conclude that shearing enhances branch 
      migration by destabilization of the double helix.

TI  - Induction of spherule formation in Physarum polycephalum by polyols.
PG  - 673-8
AB  - A method has been developed for inducing spherule formation (spherulation) in the 
      myxomycete Physarum polycephalum by transferring the culture to synthetic medium 
      containing 0.5 m mannitol or other polyols. This morphogenetic process occurred 
      within 12 to 35 hr after the inducer was added. The mature spherules existed as 
      distinct morphogenetic units, in contrast to the clusters of spherules formed during 
      starvation. Ninety per cent of the spherules germinated by 24 hr in synthetic 
      medium. The changes in the synthesis of ribonucleic acid (RNA), deoxyribonucleic 
      acid (DNA), and protein during plasmodial growth, spherulation, and germination of 
      spherules are described. When spherule formation was completed, RNA, protein, and 
      DNA decreased, compared with the values at the beginning of the conversion. The 
      incorporation of (3)H-uridine into trichloroacetic acid-insoluble material was 
      different in each of these periods, and this incorporation was sensitive to 
      actinomycin D. The amount of glycogen increased during growth, whereas it decreased 
      during spherulation. (14)C-glucose could be taken up by the cells in the presence of 
      the inducer, and mannitol could not replace glucose as a source of energy. The mode 
      of action of mannitol and its mechanism of induction are discussed.

TI  - Flow cytometric determination of nuclear DNA content during differentiation

PG  - 124-127
LID - 10.1007/BF00375935 [doi]
AB  - Using flow cytometry, spherulating nuclei of Physarum isolated at the beginning of 
      spherule wall formation were found to exhibit a DNA content corresponding to the 
      G(2) phase of the cell cycle, although 8% lower. Before the first mitosis after 
      spherule germination, a very slight incorporation of (3)H thymidine into DNA was 
      observed that was too weak to correspond to S phase, strongly suggesting that nuclei 
      are stopped in G(2) phase inside the spherules. The lower value of nuclear DNA 
      content found using flow cytometry of germinating spherules may not be related to 
      DNA quantity, but may be due to a difference in chromatin organization during growth 
      or spherulation, resulting in interference with the staining.

LID - 109
AB  - This is a literature teaching resource review for biologically inspired 
      microfluidics courses or exploring the diverse applications of microfluidics. The 
      structure is around key papers and model organisms. While courses gradually change 
      over time, a focus remains on understanding how microfluidics has developed as well 
      as what it can and cannot do for researchers. As a primary starting point, we cover 
      micro-fluid mechanics principles and microfabrication of devices. A variety of 
      applications are discussed using model prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms from the 
      set of bacteria (Escherichia coli), trypanosomes (Trypanosoma brucei), yeast 
      (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), slime molds (Physarum polycephalum), worms 
      (Caenorhabditis elegans), flies (Drosophila melangoster), plants (Arabidopsis 
      thaliana), and mouse immune cells (Mus musculus). Other engineering and biochemical 
      methods discussed include biomimetics, organ on a chip, inkjet, droplet 
      microfluidics, biotic games, and diagnostics. While we have not yet reached the 
      end-all lab on a chip, microfluidics can still be used effectively for specific 
      applications.

TI  - Cell-cycle-dependent dissociation of histone H1 from chromatin in nuclei of P. 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 3873-85
AB  - The dissociation curves of histone H1 from chromatin in interphase and metaphase 
      nuclei from Physarum polycephalum have been determined using CaCl2 as dissociating 
      agent. H1 is less strongly bound to metaphase chromosomes than to interphase 
      chromatin. However, no differences could be detected in the binding of Hl to early 
      S, late S or G2 phase chromatin. The number of CaCl2 molecules involved in binding 
      one H1 molecule to chromatin was reduced from 5 in interphase to 4 in metaphase. The 
      non-electrostatic contribution to the free-energy of binding was small in both 
      cases. A comparison of the binding properties of H1 to sheared chromatin, native 
      chromatin and metaphase chromosomes suggests that the electrostatic binding 
      functions of H1 are completely satisfied within the nucleosome and that further 
      electrostatic interactions are not involved in folding the nucleosomal fibre into 
      the 300 A "solenoid" or the more tightly folded metaphase chromosome.

TI  - Coordination of macromolecular synthesis in the slime mould Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 211-25
AB  - Microplasmodia of P. polycephalum were grown either in batch culture, in both 
      complex and defined media to give a 3-4 fold variation in growth rate, or in a 
      chemostate. The protein/DNA ratio of batch cultures was almost invariant, whilst the 
      RNA/DNA ratio increased as a non-linear function of growth rate. The amount of 
      ribosomal RNA, expressed as a fraction of total RNA, showed little variation and 
      this was also true for the proportion of ribosomes found in polyribosomes. 
      Calculation of the rate of protein synthesis per ribosome shows that this parameter 
      increases by approximately 50% over the range of growth rates studied, although it 
      should be emphasized that the effect of protein turnover has not yet been taken into 
      account. Enrichment of batch cultures growing in a defined medium produced an 
      increase in the rate of RNA synthesis. Data obtained with chemostat cultures 
      differed in several respects from those described above for batch cultures, 
      especially at low growth rates, and are discussed in relation to the early stages of 
      differentiation of microplasmodia to spherules.

TI  - Metal-free and Ca2+-bound structures of a multidomain EF-hand protein, CBP40, from 
      the lower eukaryote Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 75-85
AB  - Acellular slime mold, Physarum polycephalum, has a unique wound-healing system. When 
      cytoplasm of plasmodia is exposed to extracellular fluid, calcium binding protein 40 
      (CBP40) seals damaged areas, forming large aggregates Ca(2+) dependently. Part of 
      the CBP40 is truncated at the N terminus by a proteinase in plasmodia (CBP40delta), 
      which does not aggregate in the Ca(2+)-bound form. Here we report the crystal 
      structures of CBP40delta in both the metal-free and the Ca(2+)-bound states. Both 
      structures consist of three domains: coiled-coil, intervening, and EF-hand. The 
      topology of the EF-hand domain is similar to that of calpain. The N-terminal half of 
      CBP40Delta interacts with the C-terminal EF-hands through a large hydrophobic 
      interface, necessary for high Ca(2+) affinity. Conformational change upon Ca(2+) 
      binding is small; however, the structure of CBP40delta provides novel insights into 
      the mechanism of Ca(2+)-dependent oligomerization.

TI  - The influence of an actin-modulating protein (AM-protein) from Physarum polycephalum 
      on the cell motility of Amoeba proteus.
PG  - 43-52
AB  - An actin-modulating protein (AM-protein) isolated from the acellular slime mold 
      Physarum polycephalum and microinjected into living Amoeba proteus causes 
      characteristic changes in cell shape, locomotory behaviour, and organization of the 
      microfilament system of the amebae. The peptide chain weight of the AM-protein, 
      which binds to one actin molecule with high affinity thus forming a heterodimer, is 
      43 000. The heterodimer is a powerful inhibitor of actin polymerization, when added 
      to G-actin. A 50% inhibition is already obtained at a weight ratio of 0.05 
      AM-protein/actin. The AM-protein heterodimer has only little effect on F-actin, 
      which can be neglected under the experimental conditions used. The microinjected 
      AM-protein transforms normal locomoting polytactic amebae into orthotactic cell 
      models. The orthotactic forms are characterized by a polarized organization, i.e. a 
      flattened advancing cell pole consisting of one large pseudopod showing clear 
      suppression of further pseudopod formation, and a contracting uroid undergoing 
      cellular budding processes by the formation and vesiculation of numerous small 
      evaginations. The observed changes in morphology can be interpreted as a relaxation 
      of the advancing cell region due to a significant reduction of the polymerizable 
      actin pool. As the AM-protein heterodimer does not attack F-actin filaments or the 
      interaction of actin and myosin the middle region and the uroid of the microinjected 
      cells are able to perform contractions which result in an orthotactic moving 
      pattern. In conjunction with control experiments using double injection of 
      AM-protein and phalloidin our observations prove the important role of controlled 
      actin polymerization and depolymerization processes for cytoplasmic streaming 
      activity and cell locomotion in ameboid cells.

TI  - Purification and properties of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial malate dehydrogenases 
      of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 673-84
AB  - Two isoenzymes of malate dehydrogenase (MDH) were demonstrated in plasmodia of 
      Physarum polycephalum by polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. The more "cathodal" 
      form was uniquely associated with mitochondria (M-MDH) and the other form was found 
      in the soluble cytoplasm (S-MDH). The isoenzymes were separated by acetone 
      fractionation of soluble plasmodial homogenates acidified to pH 5.0. The M-MDH was 
      purified 201-fold by cetylpyridinium chloride treatment, fractionation with ammonium 
      sulfate, gradient elution from sulfoethyl cellulose at pH 6.0, and Sephadex G-100 
      chromatography. The S-MDH was purified 155-fold by ammonium sulfate fractionation, 
      diethylaminoethyl cellulose chromatography, gradient elution from sulfoethyl 
      cellulose at pH 5.5, and Sephadex G-100 chromatography. The optimal cis-oxalacetate 
      concentrations were 0.35 mM for M-MDH and 0.25 mM for S-MDH, and the optimal pH for 
      both isoenzymes was 7.6 for oxalacetate reduction. The optimal l-malate 
      concentrations were 5 mM for S-MDH and 6 mM for M-MDH, and both isoenzymes exhibited 
      an optimal pH of 10.0 for L-malate oxidation. The Michaelis constants of S-MDH and 
      M-MDH served to discriminate between the isoenzymes. The S-MDH was more heat-stable 
      than the M-MDH. High concentrations of oxalacetate and malate inhibited S-MDH more 
      than M-MDH. The isoenzymes were further distinguished by their utilization of 
      analogues of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. Many properties of the Physarum 
      isoenzymes were similar to those of more complex organisms, especially vertebrates.

TI  - Oscillations in cell shape and size during locomotion and in contractile activities 
      of Physarum polycephalum, Dictyostelium discoideum, Amoeba proteus and macrophages.
PG  - 79-90
AB  - Changes in cell shape and size were measured during locomotion, together with the 
      motive force of the protoplasmic streaming, in various amoeboid cells in different 
      stages of their life cycle, and under various environmental conditions. The 
      variations in these measurements with time were examined by Fourier spectral 
      analysis. Notwithstanding a change in cell type in the life cycle of P. 
      polycephalum, myxamoebae and tiny plasmodia showed a similar time pattern of 
      locomotion, exhibiting oscillations having a mixture of several periods. A regular 
      oscillation with protoplasmic streaming appeared in the plasmodium only above a 
      critical cell size. D. discoideum amoebae oscillated with two periods of a few 
      minutes in preaggregation stage, but with a period of 10 min in aggregation stage, 
      the latter being induced by cAMP. Macrophages and A. proteus also oscillated with 
      periods of a few minutes. Periods of all these oscillations were prolonged 
      severalfold by respiratory inhibition with NaCN, but were unaffected by glycolytic 
      inhibition with 2-deoxyglucose. Cell fragments of A. proteus containing fewer 
      granules oscillated more slowly and with a larger amplitude than those containing 
      more granules. Among the granules, the nucleus was excluded as a possible modifier 
      of the oscillation. The oscillation in Physarum plasmodium was reversibly suppressed 
      by combining respiratory and ATPase inhibitions in mitochondria with NaCN and 
      oligomycin, intracellular ATP concentration being kept at an appropriate level. The 
      present results show that amoeboid motility, as well as cell shape, is oscillatory 
      and that mitochondria are involved in time keeping.

TI  - Unique sequence arrangement of ribosomal genes in the palindromic rDNA molecule of 
      Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 1433-47
AB  - R-loop and restriction mapping procedures reveal the organization of coding regions 
      at each end of the giant rDNA palindrome of Physarum polycephalum. A 19S coding 
      region of 2.10 +/- 0.21 kb is located at each end of a very long central spacer 
      (35.64 +/- 2.08 kb). An internal spacer of 1.66 +/- 0.12 kb lies distal to the 19S 
      gene. The 5.8S rRNA coding region is located in this spacer. The 26S gene lies 
      distal to the internal spacer. The 26S gene is unusual among those of eukaryotes in 
      that it consists of 3 coding regions (alpha, beta and gamma) interrupted by 2 
      intervening sequences. The 26S alpha (most central) coding segment of 2.41 +/- 0.33 
      kb is separated from the 26S beta segment by an intervening sequence of 0.68 +/- 
      0.13 kb. The 26S beta segment (0.70 +/- 0.11 kb) is separated from the most distal 
      26S gamma segment (0.59 +/- 0.14 kb) by an intervening sequence of 1.21 +/- 0.14 kb. 
      The 2 intervening sequences are present in at least 88% of ribsomal genes from 
      active plasmodia, indicating that genes containing these sequences are transcribed. 
      The rDNA termini contain a heterogeneous region which varies in length by +/- 300 
      base pairs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The conventional method used to assess growth of the plasmodium of the 
      slime mold Physarum polycephalum in solid culture is to measure the extent of 
      plasmodial expansion from the point of inoculation by using a ruler. However, 
      plasmodial growth is usually rather irregular, so the values obtained are not 
      especially accurate. Similar challenges exist in quantification of the growth of a 
      fungal mycelium. RESULTS: In this paper, we describe a method that uses geographic 
      information system software to obtain highly accurate estimates of plasmodial growth 
      over time. This approach calculates plasmodial area from images obtained at 
      particular intervals following inoculation. In addition, the correlation between 
      plasmodial area and its dry cell weight value was determined. The correlation could 
      be used for biomass estimation without the need of having to terminate the cultures 
      in question. CONCLUSION: The method described herein is simple but effective and 
      could also be used for growth measurements of other microorganisms such as fungi on 
      solid media.

TI  - A hybrid living/organic electrochemical transistor based on the Physarum 
      polycephalum cell endowed with both sensing and memristive properties.
PG  - 2859-2868
LID - 10.1039/c4sc03425b [doi]
AB  - A hybrid bio-organic electrochemical transistor was developed by interfacing an 
      organic semiconductor, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with poly(styrene 
      sulfonate), with the Physarum polycephalum cell. The system shows unprecedented 
      performances since it could be operated both as a transistor, in a three-terminal 
      configuration, and as a memristive device in a two terminal configuration mode. This 
      is quite a remarkable achievement since, in the transistor mode, it can be used as a 
      very sensitive bio-sensor directly monitoring biochemical processes occurring in the 
      cell, while, as a memristive device, it represents one of the very first examples of 
      a bio-hybrid system demonstrating such a property. Our system combines memory and 
      sensing in the same system, possibly interfacing unconventional computing. The 
      system was studied by a full electrical characterization using a series of different 
      gate electrodes, namely made of Ag, Au and Pt, which typically show different 
      operation modes in organic electrochemical transistors. Our experiment demonstrates 
      that a remarkable sensing capability could potentially be implemented. We envisage 
      that this system could be classified as a Bio-Organic Sensing/Memristive Device 
      (BOSMD), where the dual functionality allows merging of the sensing and memory 
      properties, paving the way to new and unexplored opportunities in bioelectronics.

TI  - A nuclear elongation factor of transcription from Physarum polycephalum in vitro.
PG  - 253-61
AB  - Homogenates of Physarum plasmodia contain a factor which stimulates UMP 
      incorporation on native DNA by solubilized homologous RNA polymerases in vitro. The 
      factor is a heat-sensitive protein and has been located in nuclei. It does not alter 
      the template activity of DNA nor the initiation frequency of transcription. The 
      factor interacts with free or bound RNA polymerase molecules (only 37 degrees C and 
      at low ionic strength) and yields larger transcripts in vitro. The level of the 
      factor in vitro fluctuates: it is gradually reduced during spherulation and reaches 
      its maximum in mid S phase of the cell cycle of Physarum.

TI  - Three diadenosine 5',5''-P1,P4-tetraphosphate hydrolytic enzymes from Physarum 
      polycephalum with differential effects by calcium: a specific dinucleoside 
      polyphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase, a nucleotide pyrophosphatase, and a 
      phosphodiesterase.
PG  - 502-15
AB  - Two new enzymes that hydrolyze diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap4A) have been isolated 
      from the acellular slime mold Physarum polycephalum. Both enzymes are different from 
      the Physarum Ap4A symmetrical pyrophosphohydrolase previously described on the basis 
      of their substrate specificities, reaction products, molecular weights, and divalent 
      cation requirements. One enzyme is a nucleotide pyrophosphatase that asymmetrically 
      hydrolyzes Ap4A to AMP and ATP. This enzyme hydrolyzes several mono- and 
      dinucleotides with the corresponding nucleotide monophosphate as one of the 
      products. The percentage hydrolysis of NAD+, Ap4A, and Ap4G, each at 10 microM, was 
      100, 56, and 51, respectively. A divalent cation is required for activity, with Ca2+ 
      yielding 20-30 times greater activity than Mg2+ or Mn2+. Values of Km for Ap4A and 
      Vmax are similar to the corresponding values for Ap4A symmetrical 
      pyrophosphohydrolase. The second enzyme is a phosphodiesterase I with broad 
      substrate reactivity. This enzyme also asymmetrically hydrolyzes Ap4A, but it does 
      not hydrolyze NAD+. Activity of the phosphodiesterase I is stimulated by divalent 
      cations, with Ca2+ being 50-60 times more stimulatory than Mg2+ or Mn2+. The 
      apparent molecular weights of the nucleotide pyrophosphatase and phosphodiesterase 
      are 184,000 and 45,000, respectively. In contrast, the Ap4A pyrophosphohydrolase 
      hydrolyzes Ap4A to ADP, is inhibited by Ca2+ and other divalent cations, and has an 
      apparent molecular weight of 26,000 as previously reported.

TI  - Synergistic effect of heat-shock and UV-irradiation on mitosis and protein synthesis 
      in G2-phase plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum Schw--reduction in UV-induced mitotic 
      delay in a preheat-shocked system.
PG  - 305-9
AB  - The synergistic effect of UV irradiation and heat-shock during the last 3 hr of G2 
      phase of the cell cycle in the plasmodia of P. polycephalum, in terms of mitotic 
      delay and inhibition of protein synthesis, has been evaluated. The mitotic delay due 
      to both perturbers coordinately increased closer to mitosis. Maximum mitotic delay 
      was obtained in plasmodia heat-shocked after UV irradiation, indicating the presence 
      in this system of either a heat-labile mitogenic substance which is comparatively 
      less susceptible to UV or a substance which is made more susceptible to hyperthermia 
      by UV. A protective role for heat-shock applied before irradiation has been observed 
      in that, radiation-induced mitotic delay is significantly reduced in this 
      combination. There was severe inhibition of translation in all the perturbed 
      classes. Organelle level effects which are independent of major protein synthetic 
      activities or different levels of heat-shock protein production could be the reason 
      for the lack of correlation between percentage inhibition of general protein 
      synthesis and the extent of mitotic delay with respect to the two double-perturbed 
      systems.

TI  - Division of Physarum mitochondria during starvation.
PG  - 197-204
AB  - Microplasmodia of Physarum polycephalum used in this study form spherules after 18 h 
      of starvation. Stereological morphometry revealed that between the 2nd and the 5th 
      hour of starvation the number of mitochondria in 1 mm3 of cytoplasm rises from about 
      12 to 24 millions and the mean volume of mitochondria drops from circa 4.6 to 3.0 
      microns3. This denotes the synchronous division of mitochondria. The daughter 
      mitochondria show an increase in density of the matrix and a decrease in 
      condensation of the net of tubular cristae. The mitochondrial division, decrease in 
      activity of the respiratory chain and maximum of its cyanide resistance occur at the 
      same time.

AB  - We present a mathematical model for continuously distributed mechanochemical 
      autooscillations (autowaves) in a protoplasmic strand of Physarum polycephalum. The 
      model is based on a hypothesis of local positive feedback between deformation and 
      contraction of the contractile apparatus. This feedback is mediated through a cell 
      regulatory system whose kinetics involves coupling to mechanical strain. 
      Mathematical analysis and computer simulations have demonstrated that the solutions 
      of the model agree quantitatively with the available experimental data. In 
      particular, hydrodynamic interaction alone, between different sections of the strand 
      via the streaming endoplasm, is capable of inducing the characteristic contractile 
      behavior.

TI  - Characterization of thermosensitive mutants of Physarum polycephalum a plasmodial 
      screening method for cell cycle mutants based upon synchronization at the 
      restrictive temperature.
PG  - 203-8
LID - 10.1007/BF00390945 [doi]
AB  - A screening procedure for cell cycle mutants among is mutants of Physarum has been 
      developed for unsynchronized microplasmodia. The synchronization of the 
      microplasmodia and the ratio of pre- to post-mitotic nuclei were evaluated after a 
      transient shift-up to the non-permissive temperature. In contrast with wild type and 
      is mutants not blocked in a cell cycle event, putative cell cycle mutants were 
      synchronized. Among them, three strains which showed a reduction of DNA synthesis 
      had an abnormally increased ratio of pre- to post-mitotic nuclei. Thus, this 
      methodology seems to be efficient and more rapid than the previously published 
      procedures for detecting cell-cycle mutants of Physarum.

TI  - Characterization of I-Ppo, an intron-encoded endonuclease that mediates homing of a 
      group I intron in the ribosomal DNA of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 3386-96
AB  - A novel and only recently recognized class of enzymes is composed of the 
      site-specific endonucleases encoded by some group I introns. We have characterized 
      several aspects of I-Ppo, the endonuclease that mediates the mobility of intron 3 in 
      the ribosomal DNA of Physarum polycephalum. This intron is unique among mobile group 
      I introns in that it is located in nuclear DNA. We found that I-Ppo is encoded by an 
      open reading frame in the 5' half of intron 3, upstream of the sequences required 
      for self-splicing of group I introns. Either of two AUG initiation codons could 
      start this reading frame, one near the beginning of the intron and the other in the 
      upstream exon, leading to predicted polypeptides of 138 and 160 amino acid residues. 
      The longer polypeptide was the major form translated in vitro in a reticulocyte 
      extract. From nuclease assays of proteins synthesized in vitro with partially 
      deleted DNAs, we conclude that both polypeptides possess endonuclease activity. We 
      also have expressed I-Ppo in Escherichia coli, using a bacteriophage T7 RNA 
      polymerase expression system. The longer polypeptide also was the predominant form 
      made in this system. It showed enzymatic activity in bacteria in vivo, as 
      demonstrated by the cleavage of a plasmid carrying the target site. Like several 
      other intron-encoded endonucleases, I-Ppo makes a four-base staggered cut in its 
      ribosomal DNA target sequence, very near the site where intron 3 becomes integrated 
      in crosses of intron 3-containing and intron 3-lacking Physarum strains.

      nucleus/chromatin of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 47-62
AB  - The concentrations of Na, Mg, P, Cl, S, K, and Ca (m mol/kg dry wt) were measured 
      during the cell cycle of P. polycephalum using electron-probe X-ray microanalysis. 
      Significant cell cycle-associated fluctuations in the concentrations of all of these 
      elements occurs in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. In most cases the levels of 
      each element were elevated during mitosis but greatly reduced during the S phase. 
      Phosphorus and sulphur were concentrated in the nucleus/chromatin at metaphase. 
      Ultrastructural analysis of these cells reveals a phase dependent variation in the 
      density of the cytoplasmic ground substance which is most pronounced at mitosis. The 
      changes seen in the cytoplasm occur not only in conjunction with the increased 
      concentration of elements in the nucleus but also with the cessation of protoplasmic 
      migration.

TI  - Calcium binding properties of recombinant calcium binding protein 40, a major 
      calcium binding protein of lower eukaryote Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 3827-34
AB  - Calcium binding protein 40 (CBP40) is a Ca(2+)-binding protein abundant in the 
      plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum. CBP40 consists four EF-hand domains in the 
      COOH-terminal half and a putative alpha-helix domain in the NH(2)-terminal half. We 
      expressed recombinant proteins of CBP40 in Escherichia coli to investigate its 
      Ca(2+)-binding properties. Recombinant proteins of CBP40 bound 4 mol of Ca(2+) with 
      much higher affinity (pCa(1/2) = 6.5) than that of calmodulin. When residues 1-196 
      of the alpha-helix domain were deleted, the affinity for Ca(2+) decreased to 
      pCa(1/2) = 4.6. A chimeric calmodulin was generated by conjugating the alpha-helix 
      domain of CBP40 with calmodulin. The affinity of Ca(2+) for the chimeric calmodulin 
      was higher than that for calmodulin, suggesting that the alpha-helix domain is 
      responsible for the high affinity of CBP40 for Ca(2+). CBP40 forms large aggregates 
      reversibly in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. A mutant protein with a deletion of 
      NH(2)-terminal 32 residues, however, could not aggregate, indicating the importance 
      of these residues for the aggregation. The aggregation occurs above micromolar 
      levels of Ca(2+) concentration, so it may only occur when CBP40 is secreted out of 
      the plasmodial cells.

TI  - Starvation phase of Physarum polycephalum: characterization of transfer ribonucleic 
      acid.
PG  - 13-20
AB  - We have begun a series of studies designed to characterize gene expression during 
      differentiation in the slime mold Physarum polycephalum. This work concerns the 
      starvation phase of the sporulation sequence and describes some of the quantitative 
      changes which occur in plasmodial constituents during the 3-day starvation period 
      and also describes alterations in the transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) population. 
      The results show that whereas the plasmodial tRNA content decreased by 75% during 
      starvation, concurrent de novo synthesis of tRNA also occurred, and they also show 
      that overall amino acid acceptor activity of the starvation-phase tRNA population 
      did not differ significantly from that found in the growth phase. Of the 19 
      starvation-phase tRNA families assayed, however, 6 were found to have consistently 
      lower acceptor activities than did their growth-phase counterparts. Reverse-phase 
      (RPC-5) chromatographic analysis of five of those families failed to reveal any 
      major differences between growth- and starvation-phase isoacceptors. The data 
      suggest that the depletion and resynthesis of tRNA during the starvation phase 
      results in a quantitative alteration in the composition of the tRNA population and 
      that the alteration is tRNA family and not tRNA isoacceptor specific.

TI  - A Bio-Inspired Approach to Traffic Network Equilibrium Assignment Problem.
PG  - 1304-1315
LID - 10.1109/TCYB.2017.2691666 [doi]
AB  - Finding an equilibrium state of the traffic assignment plays a significant role in 
      the design of transportation networks. We adapt the path finding mathematical model 
      of slime mold Physarum polycephalum to solve the traffic equilibrium assignment 
      problem. We make three contributions in this paper. First, we propose a generalized 
      Physarum model to solve the shortest path problem in directed and asymmetric graphs. 
      Second, we extend it further to resolve the network design problem with multiple 
      source nodes and sink nodes. At last, we demonstrate that the Physarum solver 
      converges to the user-optimized (Wardrop) equilibrium by dynamically updating the 
      costs of links in the network. In addition, convergence of the developed algorithm 
      is proved. Numerical examples are used to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed 
      algorithm. The superiority of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated in comparison 
      with several other algorithms, including the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, conjugate 
      Frank-Wolfe algorithm, biconjugate Frank-Wolfe algorithm, and gradient projection 
      algorithm.

TI  - Simultaneous oscillations of Ca2+ efflux and tension generation in the permealized 
      plasmodial strand of Physarum.
PG  - 433-43
AB  - Calcium is now generally thought to play a key role in regulating a variety of 
      cellular movements. When the plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum was treated with 
      the calcium-ionophore A23187 or the quasi-ionophore amphotericin B, Ca2+ leaked out. 
      Ca2+ efflux into the ambient solution from the plasmodial strand segment was 
      measured by the luminescence of a photoprotein aequorin, and the tensile force 
      production was recorded simultaneously. Ca2+ efflux oscillated with the same period 
      as the cycle of tension generation in the strand, but the phase of cyclic changes in 
      Ca2+ efflux was opposite to that of tension generation. That is, Ca2+ efflux fell in 
      the increasing tension phase and rose in the decreasing tension phase. Cyclic 
      changes in efflux of Ca2+ are provisionally interpreted as reflecting corresponding 
      changes in concentrations of free Ca2+ in the cytoplasm.

TI  - Differential gene expression during the amoebal-plasmodial transition in Physarum.
PG  - 933-45
AB  - We have prepared cDNA libraries for amoebae and plasmodia of the acellular slime 
      mould, Physarum polycephalum. Differential screening was used to isolate 
      cell-type-specific cDNA clones (in bacteriophage M13) and both libraries yielded 
      approximately 5% of such sequences. The amoebal- and plasmodial-specific clones were 
      used to assay changes in transcription during the amoebal-plasmodial transition. The 
      results obtained substantiate the view that the switch from amoebal to plasmodial 
      characteristics occurs over several nuclear division cycles. With one exception, the 
      specific cDNAs came from single-gene families. Southern blotting experiments also 
      showed that they hybridised to identical restriction fragments from amoebal and 
      plasmodial DNAs indicating that genomic rearrangements are unlikely to be involved 
      in the regulation of these genes.

AB  - Unlike other bacteria, aerobic members of the order Actinomycetales show a close 
      biochemical relationship to the fungi by their capacity to synthesize hercynine and 
      ergothioneine. The myxomycete Physarum polycephalum, possessing the same synthetic 
      ability, also shows this relationship. Contrariwise, the unusual position of yeasts 
      as fungi is indicated by the inability of all yeastlike Ascomycetes and all except a 
      few false yeasts to synthesize these two betaines.

TI  - Synthesis and some properties of an actin-like nuclear protein in the slime mold 
      Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 705-14
AB  - A protein was extracted from isolated nuclei of the slime mold Physarum polycephalum 
      which could be labeled with radioactive precursors only during G(2) phase. The 
      native protein was purified by extraction in low-ionic-strength buffer [10 mm 
      tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane-hydrochloride] of isolated nuclei and by preparative 
      polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It was extracted from isolated nucleoli. Its 
      electrophoretic properties in three different polyacrylamide gel systems, its 
      molecular weight (44,000 +/- 3,000), its precipitability by vincaleucoblastine, a 
      vinca alkaloid, and its aggregation properties suggested that it might be actin. In 
      a direct comparison with slime mold actin purified from the cytoplasm, no difference 
      could be found between the two proteins in all these characteristics. The synthesis 
      of cytoplasmic actin was not found to occur exclusively during G(2) phase. This 
      suggested that nuclear actin was either synthesized independently from cytoplasmic 
      actin or transported into the nuclei exclusively during G(2) phase. The possible 
      role of nuclear actin during intranuclear mitosis is discussed.

AB  - Water distribution networks (WDNs) expand their service areas over time. These 
      growth dynamics are poorly understood. One facet of WDNs is that they have loops in 
      general, and closing loops may be a functionally important process for enhancing 
      their robustness and efficiency. We propose a growth model for WDNs that generates 
      networks with loops and is applicable to networks with multiple water sources. We 
      apply the proposed model to four empirical WDNs to show that it produces networks 
      whose structure is similar to that of the empirical WDNs. The comparison between the 
      empirical and modelled WDNs suggests that the empirical WDNs may realize a 
      reasonable balance between cost, efficiency and robustness in terms of the network 
      structure. We also study the design of pipe diameters based on a biological positive 
      feedback mechanism. Specifically, we apply a model inspired by Physarum polycephalum 
      to find moderate positive correlations between the empirical and modelled pipe 
      diameters. The difference between the empirical and modelled pipe diameters suggests 
      that we may be able to improve the performance of WDNs by following organizing 
      principles of biological flow networks.

TI  - Centriole size modifications during the cell cycle of the amoebae of the mxyomycete 
      Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 127-37
AB  - Anterior and posterior centrioles of Physarum amoebae are indistinguishable by their 
      size during interphase but there is a correlation between the size of the two 
      centrioles in the same amoeba. The interphase length of centrioles in diploid 
      amoebae possessing only one pair of centrioles was 11% longer than in the case of 
      the haploid strain. Treatment with taxol led to a 23 and 32% increase of the mean 
      length in interphase and blocked mitosis, respectively. Conversely, during control 
      mitosis the parental centrioles showed a 12% decrease of their mean length while the 
      size of the daughter centrioles increased progressively. Neither nocodazole nor cold 
      treatment induce a decrease of centriole length. The mean length of the cartwheel 
      structure (internal proximal part) although constant during mitosis could be 
      increased 24% in the presence of taxol. Similarly there was a correlation between 
      the number of anterior satellites and the centriole length.

TI  - Ca++ regulation in caffeine-derived microplasmodia of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 502-5
AB  - Caffeine-derived microplasmodia possess a Ca++-sequestering system which can 
      initiate motility. The experiments presented here suggest that this system is 
      membranous and nonmitochondrial in nature. Therefore, it is proposed that the 
      shuttle streaming in the plasmodium is controlled by the localized release and 
      uptake of free Ca++ from an intracellular storage system analogous to the 
      sarcoplasmic reticulum.

TI  - Pulsed magnetic fields alter the cell surface.
PG  - 275-8
AB  - Pulsed magnetic fields (PMFS) are routinely used in the medical community to 
      facilitate bone repair in clinical cases of non-union or pseudarthoses [(1984) Orth. 
      Clin. No. Am. 15, 61-87]. Although this therapeutic regimen appears to be reasonably 
      effective, the mechanism of action between specific PMFs and the target tissue 
      remains unknown. Adding urgency to the need to understand the mechanism are a wide 
      number of reports that have appeared which demonstrate that PMFs similar to those in 
      clinical use can alter many basic physiological functions. We report that a 24 h 
      exposure to PMFs alters the cell surface of Physarum polycephalum amoebae. Further, 
      using the technique of aqueous two-phase partitioning, we present evidence for 
      individual magnetic and electric field, cell surface effects.

TI  - Differential protein synthesis during sporulation in the slime mold Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 356-63
AB  - The size distribution and synthesis of polypeptide chains and the polysome patterns 
      were studied during sporulation of the slime mold Physarum polycephalum, and were 
      compared with nonsporulating controls. The proteins were divided into a 27,000 x g 
      supernatant (buffer-soluble proteins) and a pellet (buffer-insoluble proteins) while 
      still native. The sodium dodecyl sulfate complexes of the denatured proteins were 
      separated on polyacrylamide gels containing urea. The following differences were 
      found between sporulating and nonsporulating cultures. (i) The distribution of the 
      soluble proteins into bands from sporulating and control cultures was the same in 
      stained patterns; however, there was a slight shift toward increased synthesis of 
      larger polypeptide chains in the radioactivity patterns of the soluble proteins in 
      sporulating cultures. (ii) The amount of histones in the sporulating cultures was 
      less than 30% of the values in the controls. Also, histone synthesis was reduced to 
      less than 10% of that in the nonsporulating controls. In addition, proteins in three 
      defined regions, corresponding to molecular weights of 70,000 to 75,000 (I), 55,000 
      (II), and 41,000 (III), were synthesized in sporulating cultures at a rate at least 
      twice that in controls. Polypeptides corresponding to peaks I and II could be 
      extracted from purified walls of mature spores. (iii) The polysome pattern as 
      revealed by sucrose density centrifugation showed a breakdown of heavy polysomes at 
      3 hr after illumination, with their reappearance 4 hr later. The latter pattern, 
      however, differed from that of the nonsporulating control in that the amount of 
      light polysomes was reduced. This might account for the reduction in histone 
      synthesis.

TI  - Molecular cytochemistry: incorporation of fluorescently labeled actin into living 
      cells.
PG  - 857-61
AB  - Actin labeled with 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein has been incorporated into the 
      functional pool of actin in Chaos carolinensis and Physarum polycephalum by direct 
      microinjection. The functional activity of the labeled actin has been analyzed at 
      three levels of organization as: (a) with the purified actin, (b) in motile extracts 
      of cells, and (c) in living motile cells. The labeled actin exhibited normal 
      polymerization and activated myosin ATPase to a similar extent as unlabeled 
      controls. Labeled actin and endogenous actin were incorporated into contracted 
      pellets to approximately the same extent in motile cell extracts. After labeled 
      actin had been microinjected into single C. carolinensis cells, the fluorescent 
      actin spread into both the endoplasm and etoplasm without forming distinct fibrils. 
      In contrast, fluorescent bundles developed in the ectoplasm of P. polycephalum 
      following microinjection of labeled actin. This experimental method in conjunction 
      with fluorescence spectroscopic techniques could become a powerful tool for studying 
      the intracellular distribution and structural changes of components in living cells.

TI  - A fragmin-like protein from plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum that severs F-actin 
      and caps the barbed end of F-actin in a Ca2+-sensitive way.
PG  - 311-8
AB  - Many protein factors regulating actin polymerization can be extracted from plasmodia 
      of Physarum polycephalum in the presence of a high EGTA concentration (30 mM). A 
      protein factor with the molecular weight of 60,000 (60 kDa protein) was especially 
      interesting because of its fragmin-like properties. We purified and characterized 
      this 60 kDa protein in the present study. The purified 60 kDa protein enhanced the 
      initial rate of G-actin polymerization, severed F-actin, and capped the barbed end 
      of F-actin in a Ca2+-dependent way. The threshold concentration for Ca2+ was around 
      10(-6) M. The flow birefringence measurement showed that the length of F-actin 
      decreased from 2.8 to 1.0 microns depending on the concentration of 60 kDa protein 
      added to F-actin. These properties were identical to those of fragmin (Mr 42,000) 
      isolated from plasmodia (Hasegawa et al. (1980) Biochemistry 19, 2677-2683). 
      However, the molecular weight, the tryptic peptide map, and the cross-reactivities 
      with polyclonal anti-fragmin antibodies were different from those of fragmin. We 
      concluded from these results that 60 kDa protein is a new Ca2+-sensitive 
      F-actin-severing protein. Considering its similarity to fragmin, we termed the 60 
      kDa protein fragmin 60.

TI  - Cyclic nucleotide responses and radiation-induced mitotic delay in Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 341-51
AB  - The response of the plasmodial levels of cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP in Physarum 
      polycephalum to several putative phosphodiesterase inhibitors and to ionizing 
      radiation has been measured. Isobutylmethylxanthine (2 mM) induces a rapid transient 
      threefold elevation of cyclic AMP alone, with maximum response in about 10 min and 
      return to the base line in about 30 min. Theophylline (2 mM) induces a rapid, 
      sustained twofold elevation of cyclic GMP only. Caffeine (2 mM) and Ro-20-1724 (18 
      microM) both elicit a rapid transient rise in cyclic AMP, resembling the 
      isobutylmethylxanthine response, and a slow transient elevation of the cyclic GMP 
      level. Of particular interest is the rapid threefold transient elevation of the 
      cyclic AMP, but not of the cyclic GMP, level by gamma radiation. These results (1) 
      emphasize the organism and agent specificity of cyclic nucleotide responses, (2) 
      indicate that the kinetics and apparent refractory response are compatible with the 
      function of previously identified membrane receptor systems, i.e., a blue light 
      receptor and a choleragen receptor mediating cyclic AMP responses, and (3) suggest a 
      relationship between the agent-specific cyclic nucleotide responses and the 
      modification of gamma-radiation-induced delay of mitosis by the same agents, i.e., a 
      decrease in the delay by those which elevate cyclic GMP levels and an increase in 
      the delay by those which elevate only cyclic AMP levels.

      pattern for a unidirectionally migrating plasmodium, a bowl shape for a circular 
      plasmodium, a hump shape for an oval plasmodium, or a wavy pattern for plasmodia 
      stimulated with blue light or confined in a small chamber, etc. Local external 
      stimulation brought about new patterns of ATP distribution. The ATP concentrations 
      around the stimulated frontal region were reduced by about a half stimulation with 
      KCl (repellent) or casamino acids (attractant). In both cases, migration was 
      inhibited. Migration velocity increased almost linearly with increasing 
      concentration of intracellular ATP above the threshold (about 20 micrograms/mg 
      protein). Under anaerobic conditions or at low temperatures, the intracellular ATP 
      oscillated slowly with a periodicity of about 30 min. Pattern formations in the 
      intracellular ATP concentration and amoeboid coordination are discussed in terms of 
      coupled chemical oscillators in a self-organizing system.

PG  - 1323-31
AB  - Uninucleate amoebae of Physarum polycephalum strain CL undergo apogamic development 
      to form multinucleate plasmodia via an intermediate stage of large, uninucleate 
      cells irreversibly committed to plasmodial development. This amoebal-plasmodial 
      transition involves major changes in tubulin gene expression and the organization of 
      microtubular structures. We analysed the expression of the betC locus, which encodes 
      the plasmodial-specific beta 2-tubulin, during plasmodial development. A key 
      question addressed was the timing of expression of betC in relation to the last open 
      mitosis of the amoeba and the first closed mitosis of the plasmodium during the 
      transition. Culture conditions were improved to yield partly synchronous 
      differentiating cultures containing 50-60% committed cells, in order to facilitate 
      biochemical analysis of development. Northern blotting indicated that betC RNA was 
      virtually absent from amoebae and from early differentiating cultures. However, betC 
      transcripts could already be detected in differentiating cultures containing only 
      0.1% of committed cells; the relative amount of betC transcripts increased as the 
      percentage of committed cells in differentiating cultures increased. In fully 
      developed plasmodia, there was at least a 330-fold increase in the betC transcript 
      level compared to that in amoebae. We conclude that betC is activated during the 
      amoebal-plasmodial transition immediately before or during the commitment event. 
      Small amounts of beta 2-tubulin polypeptide could first be detected by Western 
      blotting around the stage of the first closed mitosis. Thus beta 2-tubulin may 
      participate in the first closed mitosis that committed cells undergo during their 
      development into plasmodia.

TI  - Variable pathways for developmental changes in composition and organization of 
      microtubules in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 383-93
AB  - The development of uninucleate amoebae into multinucleate plasmodia in myxomycetes 
      is called the amoebal-plasmodial transition (APT). During the APT in Physarum 
      polycephalum the ability to form flagellar axonemes is lost; the astral, open 
      mitosis is replaced by the anastral, closed mitosis; and cytoskeletal microtubules 
      disappear. These changes are accompanied by alterations in the repertoire of 
      expressed tubulins. Using immunofluorescence microscopy we have studied the timing 
      of loss and accumulation of developmentally regulated tubulin isotypes in relation 
      to other cellular events during the APT. We specifically asked whether changes in 
      the composition of microtubules are correlated with changes in their organization. 
      The plasmodium-specific beta 2-tubulin can first be detected in microtubules of 
      uninucleate cells after they become committed to plasmodium formation. However, rare 
      cells are observed that exhibit beta 2-tubulin at earlier or only at later stages of 
      development. Amoeba-specific acetylated alpha 3-tubulin disappears gradually during 
      development. Individual cells differ in the timing of loss of this isotype: alpha 
      3-tubulin is present in the majority of uninucleate cells, in a fraction of 
      binucleate and quadrinucleate cells, and is absent from larger multinucleate cells. 
      Cytoplasmic microtubules in uninucleate cells are organized by a single 
      microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) juxtaposed to the nucleus. Binucleate cells and 
      quadrinucleate cells exhibit variable numbers of MTOCs. Cytoplasmic microtubules 
      persist during the APT until the stage of plasmodia containing at least 100 nuclei. 
      The lack of a strict correlation between the changes in tubulin composition and 
      changes in organization of microtubular structures indicates that accumulation of 
      beta 2-tubulin and disappearance of alpha 3-tubulin isotypes are not sufficient to 
      bring about reorganization of microtubules during development. Individual cells in a 
      developing population differ not only in the succession of accumulation and loss of 
      developmentally regulated tubulins, but also in the sequences of other cellular 
      changes occurring during the APT.

TI  - The isolation of myxomyosin, an ATP-sensitive protein from the plasmodium of a 
      myxomycete.
PG  - 801-12
AB  - 1. A procedure has been developed for the preparation of an active concentrate from 
      the myxomycete, Physarum polycephalum. This concentrate responds with a lowered 
      viscosity to the addition of small amounts of ATP. The preparation recovers in 
      viscosity, and the process may be repeated. 2. In the most active concentrates, 75 
      per cent of the non-dialyzable material moves as a single boundary both in the 
      descending limb in electrophoresis and in the ultracentrifuge. It contains about 10 
      per cent ribonucleic acid, which is at least in part reversibly bound to the 
      protein. 3. The active material has been designated myxomyosin because of its origin 
      and its similarity to actomyosin in ATP response.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Quantitative analysis of differential gene expression is of central 
      importance in molecular life sciences. The Gene eXpression Profiling technology 
      (GeXP) relies on multiplex RT-PCR and subsequent capillary electrophoretic 
      separation of the amplification products and allows to quantify the transcripts of 
      at least 35 genes with a single reaction and one dye. RESULTS: We provide a kinetic 
      model of primer binding and PCR product formation as the rational basis for taking 
      and evaluating calibration curves. The calibration procedure and the model 
      predictions were validated with the help of a purposefully designed data processing 
      workflow supported by easy-to-use Perl scripts for calibration, data evaluation, and 
      quality control. We further demonstrate the robustness and linearity of 
      quantification of individual transcripts at variable relative abundance of other 
      co-amplified transcripts in a complex mixture of RNAs isolated from differentiating 
      Physarum polycephalum plasmodial cells. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that GeXP analysis 
      is a robust, sensitive, and useful method when the transcripts of tens to few 
      hundred genes are to be precisely quantified in a high number of samples.

TI  - Phylogenetic relationships among eukaryotic kingdoms inferred from ribosomal RNA 
      sequences.
PG  - 32-8
AB  - Phylogenetic trees among eukaryotic kingdoms were inferred for large- and 
      small-subunit rRNAs by using a maximum-likelihood method developed by Felsenstein. 
      Although Felsenstein's method assumes equal evolutionary rates for transitions and 
      transversions, this is apparently not the case for these data. Therefore, only 
      transversion-type substitutions were taken into account. The molecules used were 
      large-subunit rRNAs from Xenopus laevis (Animalia), rice (Plantae), Saccharomyces 
      cerevisiae (Fungi), Dictyostelium discoideum (Protista), and Physarum polycephalum 
      (Protista); and small-subunit rRNAs from maize (Plantae), S. cerevisiae, X. laevis, 
      rat (Animalia), and D. discoideum. Only conservative regions of the nucleotide 
      sequences were considered for this study. In the maximum-likelihood trees for both 
      large- and small-subunit rRNAs, Animalia and Fungi were the most closely related 
      eukaryotic kingdoms, and Plantae is the next most closely related kingdom, although 
      other branching orders among Plantae, Animalia, and Fungi were not excluded by this 
      work. These three eukaryotic kingdoms apparently shared a common ancestor after the 
      divergence of the two species of Protista, D. discoideum and P. polycephalum. These 
      two species of Protista do not form a clade, and P. polycephalum diverged first and 
      D. discoideum second from the line leading to the common ancestor of Plantae, 
      Animalia, and Fungi. The sequence data indicate that a drastic change occurred in 
      the nucleotide sequences of rRNAs during the evolutionary separation between 
      prokaryote and eukaryote.

TI  - Purification and characterization of DNA polymerase alpha from plasmodia of Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 199-206
AB  - DNA polymerase alpha from Physarum polycephalum has been purified from freshly 
      harvested microplasmodia. An inhibitory activity was removed by precipitation with 
      poly(ethyleneimine) and interfering type-beta-like DNA polymerase by chromatography 
      on phosphocellulose. The preparation was free of endonucleases and exonucleases. The 
      DNA-polymerizing polypeptide had a molecular mass of 140 kDa by polyacrylamide gel 
      electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. It was contained in purified samples 
      and in crude cell extracts. Peptides of smaller size that reacted with antibodies 
      against this protein were generated during purification and prolonged standing. 
      Molecular sizing under non-denaturing conditions resulted in high-molecular-mass 
      forms. The type of isolated DNA polymerase was established on the basis of 
      inhibition and template-primer utilization experiments underlying the classification 
      of DNA polymerases from higher eucaryotes. The majority of the DNA-polymerizing 
      activity was contained in the cell nucleus fraction and was inhibited by 
      aphidicolin. The isoelectric point (pI) was 6.7 +/- 0.2, the pH optimum at pH 6.8, 
      and the temperature optimum at 40 degrees C. Monovalent salts, Li+, Na+, NH+4, K+, 
      were inhibitory except for small activation maxima at 10 mM, 75 mM and 100 mM in the 
      case of Na+, NH+4 and K+ respectively. The bivalent cations Mg2+ and Mn2+ had broad 
      activity maxima at 3-20 mM concentrations, which were shifted to 0.05-0.1 mM in the 
      case of Mn2+ and synthetic DNA homopolymers. The numbers of molecules of DNA 
      polymerases in Physarum nuclei were calculated and compared with the established 
      number of replicons in plasmodia and with the number of molecules of DNA polymerases 
      in higher eucaryotes.

TI  - Correlation between tubulin mRNA stability and poly(A) length over the cell cycle of 
      Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 321-8
AB  - During the cell cycle of the Physarum polycephalum plasmodium, levels of 
      alpha-tubulin mRNA rise exponentially in G2 phase, reach a peak at metaphase 40-fold 
      above basal levels, and then fall exponentially to basal levels after mitosis. We 
      show that post-mitotic alpha-tubulin mRNA carries poly(A) tracts of less than 30 
      residues. By contrast, when levels of alpha-tubulin mRNA rise during G2 phase, the 
      mRNA has a poly(A) tract of approximately 80 bases. The length of the poly(A) tract 
      of any mRNA encoding actin is relatively constant at fewer than 30 bases through the 
      cycle. We have estimated the apparent rate of synthesis of alpha-tubulin mRNA at 
      different stages of the cell cycle by short-term labeling in vivo. Transcription of 
      alpha-tubulin mRNA continues even after mitosis, though the rate may be diminished 
      relative to that in late G2 phase. So, the post-mitotic molecular half-life of 
      alpha-tubulin mRNA must be less than the 19 minute half-life by which the levels of 
      this species fall. The fact that the apparent rate of alpha-tubulin mRNA synthesis 
      is not vastly greater in early G2 phase than in post-mitotic plasmodia is consistent 
      with an S-phase destabilization of alpha-tubulin mRNA molecules. Thus, the poly(A) 
      tail is shorter when the alpha-tubulin mRNA is less stable.

TI  - Cell cycle regulation of p34cdc2 kinase activity in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 683-9
AB  - The regulation of the mitotic histone H1 kinase activity has been analyzed during 
      the naturally synchronous cell cycle of Physarum polycephalum plasmodia. The 
      universal binding property of the p13suc1 Schizosaccharomyces pombe gene product was 
      used to precipitate and assay the cdc2 histone H1 kinase activity. The kinase 
      activity peaks at the beginning of metaphase and its decline, which requires protein 
      synthesis, appears to be an early event during the metaphase process. Microtubular 
      poisons, temperature shifts and DNA synthesis inhibitors were used to perturb cell 
      cycle regulatory pathways and characterize their effects on cdc2 kinase activation. 
      Our results suggest that the full activation of the mitotic kinase requires at least 
      two successive triggering signals involving microtubular components and DNA 
      synthesis.

TI  - Assembly, disassembly, and movements of the microfilament-rich ridge during the 
      amoeboflagellate transformation in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 223-34
AB  - The amoeboflagellate transformation in Physarum polycephalum involves a series of 
      dramatic changes in cell shape and motile behavior. This report describes the 
      morphological and behavioral changes through which a synchronously transforming 
      population of cells passes, stressing that, although there are a series of 
      distinguishable stages, cells at all stages display striking plasticity. Our 
      previous studies showed that amoeboflagellates transiently display a flattened 
      motile extension--the ridge--that projects from a specific location on the cell 
      surface and contains a laminar core densely packed with a series of crisscrossing 
      arrays of actin microfilaments. Details are presented here concerning the movements 
      of the ridge as well as the dynamics of ridge formation and disassembly in relation 
      to other morphogenetic events of the transformation. The ridge forms at about the 
      same time as transforming cells begin to elongate, propagates undulations parallel 
      to the long axis of the cell as the transformation proceeds, and disassembles late 
      in the transformation. Staining of fixed cells with the fluorescent probe 
      rhodaminephalloidin shows that the actin of amoeboid cells is strikingly 
      redistributed as the transformation proceeds. Amoeboflagellates contain most of the 
      stainable actin in the ridge and in a ventral-posterior spot that may be a site of 
      cell-substratum adhesion. These results provide additional insights into the 
      possible functions of the ridge and the roles of actin during the amoeboflagellate 
      transformation.

TI  - Electrical properties of the plasma membrane of microplasmodia of Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 67-77
AB  - Microplasmodia of Physarum polycephalum have been investigated by conventional 
      electrophysiological techniques. In standard medium (30 mM K+, 4 mM Ca++, 3 mM Mg++, 
      18 mM citrate buffer, pH 4.7, 22 degrees C), the transmembrane potential difference 
      Vm is around -100 mV and the membrane resistance about 0.25 omega m2. Vm is 
      insensitive to light and changes of the Na+/K+ ratio in the medium. Without bivalent 
      cations in the medium and/or in presence of metabolic inhibitors (CCCP, CN-, N3-), 
      Vm drops to about 0 mV. Under normal conditions, Vm is very sensitive to external pH 
      (pH0), displaying an almost Nernstian slope at pH0 = 3. However, when measured 
      during metabolic inhibition, Vm shows no sensitivity to pH0 over the range 3 to 6, 
      only rising (about 50 mV/pH) at pH0 = 6. Addition of glucose or sucrose (but not 
      mannitol or sorbitol) causes rapid depolarization, which partially recovers over the 
      next few minutes. Half-maximal peak depolarization (25 mV with glucose) was achieved 
      with 1 mM of the sugar. Sugar-induced depolarization was insensitive to pH0. The 
      results are discussed on the basis of Class-I models of charge transport across 
      biomembranes (Hansen, Gradmann, Sanders and Slayman, 1981, J. Membrane Biol. 
      63:165-190). Three transport systems are characterized: 1) An electrogenic H+ 
      extrusion pump with a stoichiometry of 2 H+ per metabolic energy equivalent. The 
      deprotonated form of the pump seems to be negatively charged. 2) In addition to the 
      passive K+ pathways, there is a passive H+ transport system; here the protonated 
      form seems to be positively charged. 3) A tentative H+-sugar cotransport system 
      operates far from thermodynamic equilibrium, carrying negative charge in its 
      deprotonated states.

TI  - Polyamine-activated protein kinase reaction from nuclei and nucleoli of Physarum 
      polycephalum which phosphorylates a unique Mr 70 000 nonhistone protein.
PG  - 2525-32
AB  - Methods are described for the detection and purification of a protein kinase from 
      nuclei and nucleoli of Physarum polycephalum which catalyzed transfer of phosphate 
      from [gamma-32P]ATP to a unique nonhistone protein of Mr 70 000 in a reaction that 
      was polyamine dependent. Enzymatic phosphorylation of the nonhistone protein by the 
      purified protein kinase was stimulated greatly, at times more than 60-fold, by the 
      polyamines spermidine and spermine. This unique polyamine-dependent reaction was 
      localized on the rDNA minichromosome of the nucleolus. The polyamine-dependent 
      protein kinase, which was first partially purified with the acidic nonhistone 
      protein fraction from isolated nucleoli, was resolved from at least six other 
      protein kinases by phosphocellulose chromatography into a catalytic component of Mr 
      26 000 and a complex comprised of the catalytic component associated with a 
      phosphate acceptor protein of Mr 70 000. The complex also catalyzed 
      polyamine-dependent phosphorylation of the endogenous Mr 70 000 component. The 
      resolved catalytic component catalyzed polyamine-dependent phosphorylation of a 
      dephosphorylated Mr 70 000 nonhistone protein that had been independently isolated 
      from nucleoli and previously demonstrated to have properties concordant with a 
      specific regulatory role in rRNA gene transcription [Keuhn, G. D., Affolter, H. U., 
      Atmar, V. J., Seebeck, T., Gubler, U., & Braun, R. (1979) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 
      U.S.A. 76, 2541-2545]. These studies indicate one way that the polyamines may 
      regulate rRNA gene transcription through the mediation of a highly specific 
      nonhistone protein kinase.

TI  - Structure of the extrachromosomal ribosomal RNA chromatin of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 829-43
AB  - Isolated nucleoli from exponentially growing microplasmodia of Physarum polycephalum 
      were digested with micrococcal nuclease or DNAase I, or were photoreacted with 
      trimethyl psoralen. In the coding region for the precursor of the ribosomal RNA, 
      micrococcal nuclease and DNAase I digestions show predominantly a smear, and 
      treatment with psoralen leads to a fairly continuous crosslinking of the DNA. All 
      three assays are compatible with the absence of a typical nucleosomal array in most 
      of the gene copies. In contrast, in the central non-transcribed spacer, except in 
      the immediate 5'-flanking region, micrococcal nuclease and DNAase I digestions yield 
      fragments that are multiples of a basic repeat, compatible with a nucleosomal 
      packing of this region. The crosslinking pattern with psoralen confirms this 
      conclusion. In addition, there are three sites over 400 base-pairs long that are 
      inaccessible for psoralen crosslinking. Two of these sites have been mapped to the 
      putative origins of replication. In the terminal non-transcribed spacer, except in 
      the immediate 3'-flanking region, digestions with micrococcal nuclease and DNAase I 
      give a smeared repeat. The crosslinking pattern after treatment with psoralen 
      suggests that this region is packed in nucleosomes, except for about 900 base-pairs 
      constituting the telomere regions of the linear extrachromosomal palindromic rDNA. 
      Micrococcal nuclease digestion of the immediate 5'-flanking region shows a complete 
      absence of any nucleosomal repeat, but digestion with DNAase I leads to a faint ten 
      base-pair repeat. In contrast, in the 3'-flanking regions both nuclease assays 
      indicate a chromatin structure similar to the coding region. Both flanking regions 
      are unusual with respect to psoralen crosslinking, in that crosslinking is reduced 
      both in chromatin and deproteinized DNA. On the basis of the known 
      sequence-dependent psoralen crosslinking and the established sequences in these 
      regions, crosslinking should be expected to occur. However, it does not and we 
      therefore propose the presence of an unusual DNA conformation in these regions.

TI  - Magnetic field effects on mitotic cycle length in Physarum.
PG  - 156-60
AB  - Large plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum were formed from mixtures of 
      micro-plasmodia grown in shaker cultures exposed to 2.0 G (rms), 75 Hz magnetic 
      fields and non-exposed, control cultures. The exposed cultures had been grown 
      continuously in the field and displayed a longer mitotic cycle than the controls. 
      Mixed cultures display synchronous mitosis and a cycle length intermediate to the 
      cycle lengths of exposed and control cultures. The cycle length of mixed cultures 
      varied with the proportions of the mixture in a non-linear manner. The results are 
      discussed in terms of several models.

TI  - DNA replication by a possible continuous-discontinuous mechanism in homogenates of 
      Physarum polycephalum containing dextran.
PG  - 363-71
AB  - Nuclear DNA synthesis in homogenates of Physarum is greatly stimulated by the 
      presence of dextran in the homogenizing medium. In this cell-free system, the DNA 
      precursor is incorporated approximately equally into two classes of DNA 
      intermediates. On of these is similar in size to that observed previously in the 
      intact organism, i.e. its sedimentation rate in alkaline sucrose density gradients 
      increases, presumably by chain elongation, as the organism progresses through the S 
      phase. The other class (approx. 10 S) is similar to 'Okazaki' fragments. Thus, 
      nuclear DNA synthesis in homogenates of Physarum may occur by a 
      continuous-discontinuous mechanism. Substantial DNA-synthetic activity is obtained 
      by the addition of dextran to dextran-free homogenates. Maximal activity in this 
      system requires the presence of both the nuclear and post-nuclear supernatant 
      fractions. It is possible that a partial separation and recombination of a DNA 
      polymerase and the endogenous template is effected by this procedure.

TI  - Incorporation of tubulin from an evolutionarily diverse source, Physarum 
      polycephalum, into the microtubules of a mammalian cell.
PG  - 595-605
AB  - Physarum myxamoebal tubulin was injected into PtK2 cells to determine whether 
      tubulin from this eukaryotic microbe could act as a reporter for microtubule growth 
      and dynamics in a mammalian cell. The distribution of Physarum tubulin was 
      determined by the use of a monoclonal antibody specific for Physarum tubulin and 
      unable to detect mammalian tubulin. Physarum tubulin was incorporated into the 
      microtubules of both interphase arrays and the mitotic spindle. Measurements of 
      microtubule turnover kinetics were found to be similar to those of other studies in 
      which chemically modified brain tubulin has been used. Results using this 
      heterologous system demonstrate that tubulin from an evolutionarily diverse organism 
      can be used as a marker for microtubule growth in mammalian cells. Furthermore, the 
      Physarum tubulin was able to endow the injected cells with novel properties. 
      Resistance to colchicine-induced microtubule disassembly, a characteristic of 
      Physarum tubulin, was conferred on the injected PtK2 cells. Use of this heterologous 
      reporter tubulin system has also revealed features of variation in microtubule 
      dynamics both within individual cells and between cells.

AB  - Cross-reactions of a number of glycans and polysaccharides isolated from fungi,

      discussed insofar as possible with relation to the chemical structures of the

      reactive antibodies. For example, the slime of Physarum polycephalum precipitated 
      antisera to pneumococcal type 4 and Klebsiella type K1. The polysaccharides of type 
      4 and K1 contain pyruvic acid in acetal linkage on hydroxyls 2 and 3 of sugars. 
      Therefore, pyruvic acid was looked for and found in Physarum slime. Numerous other 
      relations between chemical structure and immunological specificity are given.

AB  - Lab organisms are valuable in part because of large-scale experiments like screens, 
      but performing such experiments over long time periods by hand is arduous and 
      error-prone. Organism-handling robots could revolutionize large-scale experiments in 
      the way that liquid-handling robots accelerated molecular biology. We developed a 
      modular automated platform for large-scale experiments (MAPLE), an organism-handling 
      robot capable of conducting lab tasks and experiments, and then deployed it to 
      conduct common experiments in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, 
      Physarum polycephalum, Bombus impatiens, and Drosophila melanogaster. Focusing on 
      fruit flies, we developed a suite of experimental modules that permitted the 
      automated collection of virgin females and execution of an intricate and laborious 
      social behavior experiment. We discovered that (1) pairs of flies exhibit persistent 
      idiosyncrasies in social behavior, which (2) require olfaction and vision, and (3) 
      social interaction network structure is stable over days. These diverse examples 
      demonstrate MAPLE's versatility for automating experimental biology.

TI  - A mathematically modelled cytogel cortex exhibits periodic Ca++-modulated 
      contraction cycles seen in Physarum shuttle streaming.
PG  - 261-87
AB  - If each of many cells of an embryo (or different zones in a single cell) possess 
      identical active cytogel machinery, having the 'right' mechanochemical response 
      properties, then the collective interaction among those identical participants leads 
      automatically to the globally coherent tissue deformations seen in embryogenesis, 
      and to shuttle streaming in the plasmodial slime mould Physarum polycephalum. 
      Biologically plausible, and experimentally verifiable hypotheses are proposed 
      concerning how the tension generated by a strand of cytogel is determined by the 
      deformation it suffers and by the concentration of a contraction trigger chemical, 
      Ca2+, whose kinetics involve coupling to mechanical strain. The consequences of 
      these hypotheses, deduced by solving the appropriate differential equation systems 
      numerically, and displayed in computer-animated films, closely imitate diverse 
      tissue deformation events seen in developing embryos. The same hypotheses on cytogel 
      behaviour are used to model a thick-walled Physarum vein segment, and two such 
      segments are set up to be able to pump endoplasm back and forth between them. Under 
      certain conditions, this model exhibits spontaneous rhythmic mechanochemical 
      oscillations, many features of which correlate well with shuttle streaming in 
      Physarum. Small gradual variations of parameters, presumably under genetic control, 
      are shown to cause abrupt and biologically interesting bifurcations of the 
      qualitative behaviour of the model.

TI  - RNA polymerase activity and template activity of chromatin after butyrate induced 
      hyperacetylation of histones in Physarum.
PG  - 5405-17
AB  - We have studied the effect of sodium-n-butyrate on endogenous RNA polymerase in 
      Physarum polycephalum. 1 mM butyrate strongly reduces RNA polymerase activity 
      measured in isolated nuclei or chromatin; both RNA polymerase A as well as the 
      alpha-amanitin sensitive RNA polymerase B are equally affected. Despite a 
      concomitant hyperacetylation of histone H4 the template activity of chromatin, as 
      analyzed by in vitro transcription of the chromatin with exogenous RNA polymerase 
      from E. coli or RNA polymerase II from wheat germ, remains unaltered as compared to 
      untreated control chromatin, indicating that there is no positive correlation 
      between histone acetylation and template activity of chromatin for transcription in 
      this organism. The results further indicate, that butyrate acts primarily as a quick 
      but reversible inhibitor of protein synthesis in Physarum; the fast decrease of 
      endogenous RNA polymerase activity after butyrate treatment is due to inhibition of 
      enzyme synthesis rather than inactivation of other factors necessary for 
      transcription.

TI  - Physical relationship between replicons and transcription units in Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 104-13
AB  - Electron microscope spread preparations of nuclear chromatin derived from early 
      S-phase of Physarum reveal 'beads on a string' for nonreplicated and a portion of 
      newly replicated chromatin. Many of the early replicons contain transcription units 
      as visualized by nascent transcripts. They are, in most cases, arranged in 
      continuous length gradients on both newly replicated strands of chromatin, the 
      putative origin of replication being within the transcription unit. Preferential 
      release of DNA as acid precipitable material by DNAse I and of RNA polymerase B 
      (estimated as release of labeled alpha-amanitin bound to isolated nuclei) is 
      observed in early S-phase, but only if DNA synthesis is not inhibited. Also, 
      generation of a small particle (peak A) by staphylococcal nuclease, characteristic 
      of transcriptionally active chromatin, depends on concomitant replication of early 
      replicons. It is concluded that DNA replication is a prerequisite for its 
      transcription by RNA polymerase B. Thus, the sequential replication of the genome of 
      Physarum dictates the order of transcription during S-phase which may in part 
      control the proliferative mitotic cycle of Physarum.

TI  - Dynamic aspects of the contractile system in Physarum plasmodium. III. Cyclic 
      contraction-relaxation of the plasmodial fragment in accordance with the 
      generation-degeneration of cytoplasmic actomyosin fibrils.
PG  - 381-6
AB  - Plasmodial fragments of Physarum polycephalum, excised from anterior regions of a 
      thin-spread plasmodium, contracted-relaxed cyclicly with a period of 3-5 min. The 
      area of the fragments decreased approximately 10% during contraction. In most cases, 
      there was little endoplasmic streaming which indicates that contractions were 
      synchronized throughout the fragment. By both polarized light and fluorescence 
      microscopy, the organization and distribution of the cytoplasmic actomyosin fibrils 
      in the fragments changed in synchrony with the contraction cycle. The fibrils formed 
      during the contraction phase, and finally became a highly organized framework 
      consisting of a three-dimensional network of numerous fibrils with many converging 
      points (the nodes). During relaxation, the fibrils degenerated and disappeared 
      almost completely, though some very weak fibrils remained near the nodes and the 
      periphery. The results obtained by fluorometry of the fragments, stained with 
      rhodamine-phalloidin, suggested that the G-F transformation of actin is not the main 
      underlying process of the fibrillar formation.

TI  - Threshold phenomena in chemoreception and taxis in slime mold Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 223-34
AB  - The plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum reacts to various kinds of chemicals 
      substances and moves towards or away from them. Threshold concentration of 
      recognition of chemicals was examined in terms of membrane potential and of the 
      averaged motive force of tactic movement by using a double-chamber method, i.e., a 
      single plasmodium was placed between two compartments through a narrow ditch, and 
      differences in membrane potential and in pressure between two compartments were 
      measured. Results are summarized as follows: (a) By increasing the concentration of 
      various substances in one compartment, the membrane potential started to change at a 
      certain threshold concentration, C-th, for each chemical. Chemotactic movement of 
      the plasmodium took place at the same threshold concentration. These results held 
      both for attractants (glucose, galactose, phosphates, pyrophosphates, ATP, c-AMP, 
      etc) and for repellents (various inorganic salts, sucrose, fructose, etc.). (b) The 
      threshold concentration, Cth, for inorganic salts decreased remarkably with increase 
      of the valences of cations, zeta, and was proportional to Z-6, I.E., THE 
      Shultze-Hardy rule known in the field of colloid chemistry was found to be 
      applicable. (c) The plasmodium distinguished the species of monovalent cations in 
      the following order: H(Li(K(Na(Rb(Cs(NH-4 Plots of log Cth against the lyotropic 
      number of anion fell on different straight lines for each monovalent cation species. 
      (d) Plots of log Cth, against the reciprocal of the absolute tempe lines were almost 
      the same and gave a value of 12 kcal/mol for the enthalpy change. These results 
      suggest that the recognition of chemical substances appears as the result of a 
      structural change of the membrane at the threshold point, and that the change in 
      membrane structure is transmitted simultaneously to the motile system of the 
      plasmodium.

TI  - Reaction-diffusion-advection model for pattern formation of rhythmic contraction in 
      a giant amoeboid cell of the physarum plasmodium.
PG  - 497-506
AB  - The plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum is a large amoeboid organism showing 
      rhythmic contraction everywhere within an organism, and moves by forming 
      spatio-temporal patterns of the rhythmic contraction. We propose a 
      reaction-diffusion-advection model for the pattern formation. This model is 
      constructed under physiological suggestions that the chemical oscillator acts as a 
      clock regulating the rhythmic contraction and interacts spatially not only by 
      diffusion but also by advection of protoplasm. Behavior of the model is studied by 
      numerical calculation, especially the effects of the advection term on a simple 
      reaction-diffusion system. The advection effect reproduces experimentally observed 
      phenomena of fluctuating propagation of the contraction wave. Concept of the 
      reaction-diffusion-advection system is promising for modeling the mechanism of 
      amoeboid behaviour in the Physarum plasmodium. Copyright 1999 Academic Press.

TI  - Tension generation by actomyosin thread from a non-muscle system.
PG  - 169-71
AB  - A suitable motility model reconstituted from non-muscle contractile proteins should 
      offer a powerful tool for analysing the molecular events in cell motility. 
      Actomyosin thread has been thought to be such a model. As far as non-muscle motile 
      systems are concerned, however, only a very limited number of experiments have been 
      done in this direction. No direct measurement of the tension produced by 
      non-muscular actomyosin thread has been reported in spite of its importance for 
      quantitative studies. We now report that a segment of actomyosin thread of Physarum 
      polycephalum can generate a considerable amount of tension, which is a function of 
      the micromolar concentration of ATP. The maximum isometric tension was a high as 10 
      g cm-2 at 10 microM ATP.

TI  - The subunit structure of chromatin from Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 3313-29
AB  - Nucleosome DNA repeat lengths in Physarum chromatin, determined by nuclease 
      digestion experiments, are shorter than those observed in most mammalian chromatin 
      and longer than those reported for chromatin of certain other lower eukaryotes. 
      After digestion with staphylococcal nuclease for short periods of time an average 
      repeat length of 190 base pairs is measured. After more extensive digestion an 
      average repeat length of 172 base pairs is measured. Upon prolonged digestion DNA is 
      degraded to an average monomer subunit length of 160 base pairs, with only a small 
      amount of DNA found in lengths of 130 base pairs or smaller. Mathematical analysis 
      of the data suggests that the Physarum nucleosome DNA repeat comprises a protected 
      DNA segment of about 159 base pairs with a nuclease-accessible interconnecting 
      segment which ranges from 13 to 31 base pairs. The spacing data are compatible with 
      measurements from electron micrographs of Physarum chromatin.

TI  - Actomyosin content of Physarum plasmodia and detection of immunological 
      cross-reactions with myosins from related species.
PG  - 393-406
AB  - The content of myosin in plasmodia of the myxomycete Physarum polycephalum was 
      measured by an immunological technique, quantitative microcomplement (C') fixation. 
      Migrating plasmodia (starved after growth on rolled oats) contained 0.60 +/- 0.08 
      (SD) mg myosin per g fresh plasmodia. Myosin comprised 0.77% +/- 0.05 (SD) of the 
      total plasmodial protein. When total plasmodial proteins were separated by 
      electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, a large amount of protein appeared in a 
      band comigrating with muscle actin. Densitometry performed after Coomassie blue 
      staining indicated that as much as 15-25% of the total protein in the plasmodium 
      could be actin. This gives an actin/myosin ratio by weight in the myxomycete 
      plasmodium as high as 19-33, a very "actin-rich" actomyosin compared with rabbit 
      skeletal muscle actomyosin with an actin/myosin ratio of 0.6. Starvation stimulates 
      rapid migration and is correlated with a higher percent of both myosin and actin in 
      the total protein of the plasmodium compared with normally growing cultures. 
      Immunological cross-reaction of myosins from a variety of species was measured by C' 
      fixation using an antiserum produced against purified native myosin from P. 
      polycephalum. Although myxomycete and vertebrate striated muscle myosins have very 
      similar morphological and biochemical properties, and apparently possess similar 
      binding properties to F-actin, only myosins from myxomycetes in the order 
      Physarales, rather closely related to P. polycephalum, gave detectable 
      cross-reactions. This finding suggests that many amino acid sequences in myosin have 
      been variable during evolution.

TI  - An abundant family of methylated repetitive sequences dominates the genome of 
      Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 7777-88
AB  - A significant portion (20%) of the Physarum genome can be isolated as a 
      HpaII-resistant, methylated fraction. Cloned DNA probes containing highly-repeated 
      sequences derived from this fraction were used to define the pattern of structural 
      organisation of homologous repeats in Physarum genomic DNA. It is shown that the 
      probes detect an abundant, methylated family of sequences with an estimated genomic 
      repetition frequency greater than 2100, derived from a large repeated element whose 
      length exceeds 5.8kb. Sequences comprising the long repetitive element dominate the 
      HpaII-resistant compartment and account for between 4-20% of the Physarum genome. 
      Detailed restriction/hybridisation analysis of cloned DNA segments derived from this 
      compartment shows that HpaII/MspI restriction sites within some copies of the long 
      repeated sequence are probably deleted by mutation. Additionally, segments of the 
      repeat are often found in different organisational patterns that represent scrambled 
      versions of its basic structure, and which are presumed to have arisen as a result 
      of recombinational rearrangement in situ in the Physarum genome. Preliminary 
      experiments indicate that the sequences are transcribed and that the structural 
      properties of the repeat bear some resemblance to those of transposable genetic 
      elements defined in other eukaryotic species.

TI  - FIBRILLAR DIFFERENTIATION IN MYXOMYCETE PLASMODIA.
PG  - 305-18
AB  - Myxomycete plasmodia of four different types (not including Physarum polycephalum) 
      were studied in thin sections viewed in the electron microscope. In the cytoplasm of 
      the protoplasmodia of Clastoderma debaryanum and the phaneroplasmodia of Fuligo 
      septica fixed in situ, fibrillar differentiations of three rather distinct kinds 
      were observed. One of these is filamentous and closely resembles the filaments (or 
      "microtubules") of the mitotic apparatus of other species. The larger 
      phaneroplasmodia of two species belonging to the Physarales and the plasmodium of 
      Hemitrichia vesparium showed fewer and less well defined fibrils, and no fibrils 
      were seen in the aphanoplasmodium of Stemonitis fusca. Good stabilization of such 
      fibrils in larger plasmodia may require fixation methods more rigidly controlled 
      than those which succeed with microscopic protoplasmodia. The function of the 
      observed fibrils cannot yet be determined. Their presence in cytoplasm fixed in 
      situ, however, lends support to those theories of protoplasmic movement which are 
      dependent on integral cross-bonding of one or a few molecular species.

TI  - Activity, isoenzyme pattern, and synthesis of UDPglucose 4-epimerase during 
      differtiation of Physarium polycephalum.
PG  - 493-500
AB  - 1. The specific activity of UDPglucose 4-epimerase (EC 5.1.3.2) increases by about 
      50% during the first 24 h of starvation-induced differentiation (spherulation) of 
      Physarum polycephalum. 2. At all stages during differentiation, the enzyme activity 
      is very sensitive to actinomycin-C and cycloheximide, inhibitors of transcription 
      and translation, with a half life against cycloheximide of about 20 min (if added 12 
      h after the induction of differentiation). 3. The isoenzyme pattern, as revealed by 
      isoelectric focusing in sucrose gradients, does not change during spherulation. One 
      main band with a pI of 6.7, with a shoulder (pI 7.6) and a minor band (pI 6.0) was 
      observed in extracts both from growing and differentiating cultures. 4. Density 
      labelling experiments using deuterated amino acids with subsequent analysis by 
      equilibrium density gradient sedimentation in 15-35% (w/w) metrizamide gradients 
      revealed a rather slow rate of enzyme synthesis, which is in contrast to the 
      observed high sensitivity against actinomycin-C and cycloheximide.

TI  - Nucleolar introns from Physarum flavicomum contain insertion elements that may 
      explain how mobile group I introns gained their open reading frames.
PG  - 4553-9
AB  - Comparison of two group I intron sequences in the nucleolar genome of the myxomycete 
      Physarum flavicomum to their homologs in the closely related Physarum polycephalum 
      revealed insertion-like elements. One of the insertion-like elements consists of two 
      repetitive sequence motifs of 11 and 101 bp in five and three copies, respectively. 
      The smaller motif, which flanks the larger, resembles a target duplication and 
      indicates a relationship to transposons or retroelements. The insertion-like 
      elements are found in the peripheral loops of the RNA structure; the positions 
      occupied by the ORFs of mobile nucleolar group I introns. The P. flavicomum introns 
      are 1184 and 637 bp in size, located in the large subunit ribosomal RNA gene, and 
      can be folded into group I intron structures at the RNA level. However, the intron 
      2s from both P. flavicomum and P. polycephalum contain an unusual core region that 
      lacks the P8 segment. None of the introns are able to self-splice in vitro. Southern 
      analysis of different isolates indicates that the introns are not optional in 
      myxomycetes.

TI  - Profiles of Physarum Microplasmodial Phosphatase Activity Crucial to Cytoplasmic

PG  - 357-366
LID - 10.1007/s12013-019-00885-2 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to investigate for the first time, the profile of Physarum 
      microplasmodial phosphatase (PPH) activity toward the phosphorylated light chain of 
      Physarum myosin II (PLCM) at pH 7.6, the velocity of cytoplasmic streaming, and PPH 
      expression in spherule formation during dark starvation (DS). In this study, we 
      cloned the full-length cDNA of PPH using polymerase chain reaction, based on the 
      N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme. The cDNA contained an open 
      reading frame (ORF) of 1245 bp, corresponding to 415 amino acids. We confirmed that 
      a rapid increase in PPH activity toward PLCM and a rapid decrease in cytoplasmic 
      streaming velocity precede spherule formation by Physarum microplasmodia. The 
      profiles of increase in PPH activity toward PLCM, PPH expression, and PPH 
      accumulation during DS were correlated with spherule formation in the Physarum 
      microplasmodia. Moreover, application of the wheat germ cell-free expression system 
      resulted in the successful production of recombinant PPH and in the expression of 
      phosphatase activity toward PLCM. These results suggest that PPH is involved in the 
      cessation of cytoplasmic streaming in Physarum microplasmodia during DS.

TI  - Functional fusion of living systems with synthetic electrode interfaces.
PG  - 296-301
LID - 10.3762/bjnano.7.27 [doi]
AB  - The functional fusion of "living" biomaterial (such as cells) with synthetic systems 
      has developed into a principal ambition for various scientific disciplines. In 
      particular, emerging fields such as bionics and nanomedicine integrate advanced 
      nanomaterials with biomolecules, cells and organisms in order to develop novel 
      strategies for applications, including energy production or real-time diagnostics 
      utilizing biomolecular machineries "perfected" during billion years of evolution. To 
      date, hardware-wetware interfaces that sample or modulate bioelectric potentials, 
      such as neuroprostheses or implantable energy harvesters, are mostly based on 
      microelectrodes brought into the closest possible contact with the targeted cells. 
      Recently, the possibility of using electrochemical gradients of the inner ear for 
      technical applications was demonstrated using implanted electrodes, where 1.12 nW of 
      electrical power was harvested from the guinea pig endocochlear potential for up to 
      5 h (Mercier, P.; Lysaght, A.; Bandyopadhyay, S.; Chandrakasan, A.; Stankovic, K. 
      Nat. Biotech. 2012, 30, 1240-1243). More recent approaches employ nanowires (NWs) 
      able to penetrate the cellular membrane and to record extra- and intracellular 
      electrical signals, in some cases with subcellular resolution (Spira, M.; Hai, A. 
      Nat. Nano. 2013, 8, 83-94). Such techniques include nanoelectric scaffolds 
      containing free-standing silicon NWs (Robinson, J. T.; Jorgolli, M.; Shalek, A. K.; 
      Yoon, M. H.; Gertner, R. S.; Park, H. Nat Nanotechnol. 2012, 10, 180-184) or NW 
      field-effect transistors (Qing, Q.; Jiang, Z.; Xu, L.; Gao, R.; Mai, L.; Lieber, C. 
      Nat. Nano. 2013, 9, 142-147), vertically aligned gallium phosphide NWs (Hällström, 
      W.; Mårtensson, T.; Prinz, C.; Gustavsson, P.; Montelius, L.; Samuelson, L.; Kanje, 
      M. Nano Lett. 2007, 7, 2960-2965) or individually contacted, electrically active 
      carbon nanofibers. The latter of these approaches is capable of recording electrical 
      responses from oxidative events occurring in intercellular regions of neuronal 
      cultures (Zhang, D.; Rand, E.; Marsh, M.; Andrews, R.; Lee, K.; Meyyappan, M.; 
      Koehne, J. Mol. Neurobiol. 2013, 48, 380-385). Employing monocrystalline gold, 
      nanoelectrode interfaces, we have now achieved stable, functional access to the 
      electrochemical machinery of individual Physarum polycephalum slime mold cells. We 
      demonstrate the "symbionic" union, allowing for electrophysiological measurements, 
      functioning as autonomous sensors and capable of producing nanowatts of electric 
      power. This represents a further step towards the future development of 
      groundbreaking, cell-based technologies, such as bionic sensory systems or 
      miniaturized energy sources to power various devices, or even "intelligent 
      implants", constantly refueled by their surrounding nutrients.

      Rusch. Hematin-requiring plasmodial myxomycete. J. Bacteriol. 84:1104-1110. 
      1962.-The myxomycete Physarum polycephalum, previously shown to require chick embryo 
      extract for growth on a partially defined, soluble medium, grows as well if hematin 
      or certain hemoproteins are substituted for the embryo extract. Hematin is also 
      required as a growth factor if the organism is grown on a synthetic medium. Of the 
      variety of porphyrins tested only iron protoporphyrin IX is utilized for growth by 
      P. polycephalum. Protoporphyrin IX is inactive. Protein-bound iron porphyrin is 
      active at one-tenth the concentration of free hematin. Although hematin completely 
      replaces embryo extract, the extract activity has properties not characteristic of 
      hematin or the hemoproteins tested: ladility to light and rapid plasmodial uptake.

TI  - Differential synthesis of histone H1 during early spherulation in Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 56-62
AB  - H1 and P2 (an H1 degree/HMG-like protein) accumulate during exponential growth of 
      Physarum microplasmodia (unpublished results), indicating that these proteins may 
      play a role in differentiation (spherulation). To test this hypothesis, pulse 
      labelling using [14C]lysine was used to determine whether any differential histone 
      synthesis occurs during salts-induced spherulation. A peak in the uptake of 
      [14C]lysine into microplasmodia was detected between 12 and 24 h following 
      salts-induction. During the same interval, incorporation of label into the 
      CaCl2-extracted histones occurred, with H1 being synthesised at approx. 3 times the 
      level of the core histones and P2. Densitometry of SDS-PAGE gels showed that high 
      levels of H1 were maintained up to 40 h in salts medium, beyond the observed peak in 
      synthesis. The synthesis and accumulation of high levels of H1 during early 
      spherulation indicates a role for this histone in the initiation and maintenance of 
      a transcriptionally inactive differentiated state.

TI  - Control of ornithine decarboxylase activity in Physarum by polyamines.
PG  - 325-31
AB  - The addition of putrescine, spermidine, or spermine, to cultures of Physarum 
      polycephalum rapidly reduced the activity of ornithine decarboxylase, with maximal 
      inhibition, 80-90%, occurring after 90 min. This response was not due to a decrease 
      in enzyme molecules, but rather to the rapid conversion of the active enzyme to a 
      stable, catalytically less active form. This response to exogenous polyamines was 
      not accompanied by the appearance of a macromolecular inhibitor (antizyme) either 
      free, or bound to the enzyme. Physiological levels of the polyamines were also found 
      to inhibit this enzyme in vitro both competitively and non-competitively, and to 
      promote complete yet reversible inactivation of this enzyme in the absence of 
      reducing agents. The data suggest that the control of this enzyme by endogenous 
      polyamine levels may be distinct from its response to exogenous polyamines.

      surface.
PG  - 13-6
AB  - There is a considerable controversy over the nature of weak electromagnetic-field 
      effects in living organisms. Part of the controversy can be traced to a lack of 
      understanding of whether electric or magnetic fields are involved in producing 
      bioeffects. We find that both 60 Hz electric and magnetic fields alter the cell 
      surface of Physarum polycephalum. Exposure to electric fields increases the negative 
      charge on the cell surface while magnetic-field exposure decreases the hydrophobic 
      character of the surface. These effects appear to be additive and independent of the 
      waveform of the applied fields.

AB  - Growth-associated histone kinases have been extracted from Physarum polycephalum 
      nuclei and resolved into two components by ion-exchange chromatography. The two 
      component activities have different substrate specificities and different times of 
      appearance in the cell cycle. It is proposed that the enzyme(s) phosphorylate H1 
      histone in vivo in G2 phase, possibly sequentially in time at different sites in the 
      H1 amino acid sequence.

TI  - Lack of correlation between histone H4 acetylation and transcription during the 
      Physarum cell cycle.
PG  - 446-8
AB  - The interaction between nucleosomal proteins and DNA is expected to change during 
      DNA replication as well as during transcription. A possible way of achieving the 
      necessary structural changes is the modification of histones and high mobility group 
      (HMG) proteins. The acetylation of core histones has been studied in various systems 
      (for a review see ref. 1) and a correlation between histone acetylation and 
      transcriptional activity of chromatin has frequently been proposed. In particular, 
      Bradbury and co-workers have reported a cell cycle dependence of histone H4 
      acetylation in Physarum polycephalum which revealed two correlations: (1) 
      tetraacetylated H4 (H4Ac4) correlated with the rate of transcription and (2) H4 
      acetylation was inversely correlated with H1 phosphorylation in mitosis. We present 
      evidence here that H4 acetylation does not fit these correlations. Our data clearly 
      show that the acetate content of H4 is high during the S phase, but low during later 
      stages of the cell cycle. H4Ac4 remains at a nearly constant level during the whole 
      cycle, with an elevation during the S phase. Furthermore, experiments with the 
      deacetylase inhibitor sodium-n-butyrate do not support the proposed connection 
      between diacetylated H4 (H4Ac2) and DNA replication. Our data imply that a 
      correlation of H4 acetylation and transcription is unlikely during the cell cycle of 
      Physarum. The conclusions of Bradbury and co-workers are therefore invalid.

TI  - A would-be nervous system made from a slime mold.
PG  - 73-91
LID - 10.1162/ARTL_a_00153 [doi]
AB  - The slime mold Physarum polycephalum is a huge single cell that has proved to be a 
      fruitful material for designing novel computing architectures. The slime mold is 
      capable of sensing tactile, chemical, and optical stimuli and converting them to 
      characteristic patterns of its electrical potential oscillations. The electrical 
      responses to stimuli may propagate along protoplasmic tubes for distances exceeding 
      tens of centimeters, as impulses in neural pathways do. A slime mold makes decisions 
      about its propagation direction based on information fusion from thousands of 
      spatially extended protoplasmic loci, similarly to a neuron collecting information 
      from its dendritic tree. The analogy is distant yet inspiring. We speculate on 
      whether alternative-would-be-nervous systems can be developed and practically 
      implemented from the slime mold. We uncover analogies between the slime mold and 
      neurons, and demonstrate that the slime mold can play the roles of primitive 
      mechanoreceptors, photoreceptors, and chemoreceptors; we also show how the Physarum 
      neural pathways develop. The results constituted the first step towards experimental 
      laboratory studies of nervous system implementation in slime molds.

TI  - Structure and expression of an alpha-tubulin gene of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 583-92
AB  - Fragments of Physarum polycephalum DNA generated by partial digestion with Sau3A 
      were cloned into phage-lambda EMBL4. A recombinant (phage-lambda E alpha Tu) 
      containing an alpha-tubulin (E alpha-tubulin) gene was isolated. The E alpha-tubulin 
      gene is part of the alt B locus. The gene was sequenced and was found to contain 
      seven intervening sequences. The alpha-tubulin isotype (E alpha-tubulin) encoded by 
      the gene has a methionine residue at the C-terminus. The E alpha-tubulin gene has 
      much in common with the N alpha-tubulin gene cloned into phage-lambda NM1149 [M. J. 
      Monteiro & R. A. Cox (1987) J. Mol. Biol. 193, 427-438]. However, the gene products 
      E alpha-tubulin and N alpha-tubulin differ in amino acid sequence near to the 
      C-terminus. E-peptide (corresponding to amino acids 440-448 of E alpha-tubulin) and 
      N-peptide (corresponding to amino acids 437-445 of N alpha-tubulin) were synthesised 
      and used to raise antibodies (E-antibodies and N-antibodies). The antibodies were 
      used to show that on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis N alpha-tubulin travels to 
      the alpha 1 position and E alpha-tubulin moves to the alpha 2 position. 
      Gene-specific DNA probes were used to show that transcripts of the E alpha-tubulin 
      gene were present in the plasmodial but not in the amoebal phase of the life cycle. 
      The E- and N-antibodies detected E alpha- and N alpha-tubulins in plasmodia but not 
      in amoebae, confirming that the expression of the E alpha- and N alpha-tubulin genes 
      is regulated during development. E alpha- and N alpha-tubulin were shown to be 
      components of spindle microtubules by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy.

TI  - Sequence organisation in nuclear DNA from Physarum polycephalum. Arrangement of 
      highly-repeated sequences.
PG  - 214-23
AB  - Recombinant plasmids containing highly repetitive Physarum DNA segments were 
      identified by colony hybridisation using a radioactively-labelled total Physarum DNA 
      probe. A large number of these clones also hybridised to a foldback DNA probe 
      purified from Physarum nuclear DNA. The foldback DNA probe was characterised by 
      reassociation kinetic analysis. About one-half of this component was shown to 
      consist of highly repeated sequences with a kinetic complexity of 1100 bp and an 
      average repetition frequency of 5200. Direct screening of 67 recombinant plasmids 
      for foldback sequences using the electron microscope revealed that about one-half 
      were located in segments of DNA containing highly repetitive sequences; the 
      remainder were present in clones containing low-copy number repeated elements. 
      Analysis of two DNA clones showed that they contained repetitive elements located in 
      over half of all DNA segments containing highly repetitive DNA and that the foci 
      containing these highly repetitive sequences had different sequence arrangements. 
      The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the most highly repeated DNA 
      sequence families in the Physarum genome are few in number and are clustered 
      together in different arrangements in about one-sixth of the genome. Over one-half 
      of the foldback DNA complement in the Physarum genome is derived from these segments 
      of DNA.

TI  - Physarum action. Observations on its presence, stability, and assembly in plasmodial 
      extracts and development of an improved purification procedure.
PG  - 4862-71
AB  - Actin is readily extracted from plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum by low ionic 
      strength solutions which do not solubilize the plasmodial myosin. The actin in such 
      extracts exists predominantly as a monomer which slowly denatures, apparently via 
      removal of bound nucleotide, and is subsequently proteolyzed. However, the native 
      monomeric actin can be induced to assemble into polymeric arrays under appropriate 
      solvent conditions. Actin assembly is dependent on the addition of ATP and is a 
      function of KCl and CaCl2 concentrations. These observations have allowed the 
      development of an improved actin purification scheme which is simple, rapid, and 
      efficient, yielding approximately 60 mg of protein from 100 g of plasmodium. The 
      actin thus obtained is pure, stable, and comparable to that obtained by previously 
      described procedlres. Furthermore, the observations suggest that actin polymers may 
      be metastably assembled in vivo and raise the possibility that actin assembly, and 
      plasmodial movements, could be regulated via alterations in intracellular 
      concentrations of nucleotide and/or divalent cation.

TI  - RNA editing in Physarum mitochondria: assays and biochemical approaches.
PG  - 143-72
AB  - Mitochondrial RNAs in the myxomycete Physarum polycephalum differ from the templates 
      from which they are transcribed in defined ways. Most transcripts contain 
      nucleotides that are not present in their respective genes. These "extra" 
      nucleotides are added during RNA synthesis by an unknown mechanism. Other 
      differences observed between Physarum mitochondrial RNAs and the mitochondrial 
      genome include nucleotide deletions, C to U changes, and the replacement of one 
      nucleotide for another at the 5' end of tRNAs. All of these alterations are 
      remarkably precise and highly efficient in vivo. Many of these editing events can be 
      replicated in vitro, and here we describe both the in vitro systems used to study 
      editing in Physarum mitochondria and the assays that have been developed to assess 
      the extent of editing of RNAs generated in these systems at individual sites.

TI  - Amphibian oocyte maturation induced by extracts of Physarum polycephalum in mitosis.
PG  - 1445-52
AB  - The orderly progression of eukaryotic cells from interphase to mitosis requires the 
      close coordination of various nuclear and cytoplasmic events. Studies from our 
      laboratory and others on animal cells indicate that two activities, one present 
      mainly in mitotic cells and the other exclusively in G1-phase cells, play a pivotal 
      role in the regulation of initiation and completion of mitosis, respectively. The 
      purpose of this study was to investigate whether these activities are expressed in 
      the slime mold Physarum polycephalum in which all the nuclei traverse the cell cycle 
      in natural synchrony. Extracts were prepared from plasmodia in various phases of the 
      cell cycle and tested for their ability to induce germinal vesicle breakdown and 
      chromosome condensation after microinjection into Xenopus laevis oocytes. We found 
      that extract of cells at 10-20 min before metaphase consistently induced germinal 
      vesicle breakdown in oocytes. Preliminary characterization, including purification 
      on a DNA-cellulose affinity column, indicated that the mitotic factors from Physarum 
      were functionally very similar to HeLa mitotic factors. We also identified a number 
      of mitosis-specific antigens in extracts from Physarum plasmodia, similar to those 
      of HeLa cells, using the mitosis-specific monoclonal antibodies MPM-2 and MPM-7. 
      Interestingly, we also observed an activity in Physarum at 45 min after metaphase 
      (i.e., in early S phase since it has no G1) that is usually present in HeLa cells 
      only during the G1 phase of the cell cycle. These are the first studies to show that 
      maturation-promoting factor activity is present in Physarum during mitosis and is 
      replaced by the G1 factor (or anti-maturation-promoting factor) activity in a 
      postmitotic stage. A comparative study of these factors in this slime mold and in 
      mammalian cells would be extremely valuable in further understanding their function 
      in the regulation of eukaryotic cell cycle and their evolutionary relationship to 
      one another.

TI  - [Isolation and characterization of the ALP1 protease from Aspergillus fumigatus and 
      its protein inhibitor from Physarium polycephalum].
PG  - 259-68
AB  - It is known that Aspergillus fumigatus secretes a serine protease ALP1 of the 
      subtilisin family in the presence of extracellular protein substrates. We found 
      conditions of A. fumigatus culturing that provide a high ALP1 activity inside cells 
      without induction by extracellular proteins. The identity of the properties of the 
      secreted and intracellular enzymes was shown. A thermostable protein inhibitor of 
      the ALP1 protease was isolated from the plasmodium of the myxomycete Physarum 
      polycephalum. Its molecular mass is 32-33 kDa. The inhibitor inhibits the ALP1 
      protease activity with IC50 of 0.14 microM. This protein was also shown to be a less 
      efficient inhibitor of the activity of HIV-1 protease (IC50 2.5 microM). The English 
      version of the paper: Russian Journal of Bioorganic Chemistry, 2005, vol. 31, no. 3;

TI  - The influence of microinjected phalloidin on locomotion, protoplasmic streaming and 
      cytoplasmic organization in Amoeba proteus and Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 114-31
AB  - Microinjected phalloidin induces both time and concentration-dependent changes in 
      morphology and motility of amoebae and acellular slime moulds. In A. proteus 
      injection of a 10(-3)M solution of the drug causes a separation of cortical hyaline 
      plasma from central granular plasma. Simultaneously protoplasmic streaming and 
      cellular locomotion are lost irreversibly. Lowering the concentration of phalloidin 
      to 2 x 10(-4)M results in a reversible disturbance; amoebae recover after 30 to 60 
      minutes and show normal movement. In Ph. polycephalum the injection of a 10(-3)M 
      solution of phalloidin into single veins induces a local gelation of the protoplasm 
      followed by the separation of hyalo- and granuloplasm. In semi-thin and ultrathin 
      sections the hyaline plasma regions contain a fine granular groundplasm rich in 
      ribosomes but free of cellular organelles. The central granular plasma consists 
      mainly of membrane-surrounded cellular compartments. The two morphologically 
      distinct plasma regions are separated by a 0.5 to 1.0 micrometer layer of 
      filamentous material. In A. proteus the filamentous layer is found shortly after 
      phalloidin injection in close proximity to the plasma membrane, and consists of thin 
      5 to 6 nm filaments. With increasing time this layer contracts, separates from the 
      inner plasma membrane and moves to the interior of the cell. During contraction 
      thicker filaments with diameters of 10 to 30 nm and lengths of 300 to 500 nm are 
      formed. The results indicate that the display and contraction of the 
      phalloidin-induced filament layer can account for the changes observed in cellular 
      movement and cytoplasmic organization. The resulting phenomena i.e. separation of 
      hyaline plasma from granular plasma and changes in both the protoplasmic streaming 
      pattern and locomotory activity of the cells, are discussed in terms of a general 
      understanding of amoeboid movement.

TI  - Evolution of hierarchical cytoplasmic inheritance in the plasmodial slime mold 
      Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 710-22
AB  - A striking linear dominance relationship for uniparental mitochondrial transmission 
      is known between many mating types of plasmodial slime mold Physarum polycephalum. 
      We herein examine how such hierarchical cytoplasmic inheritance evolves in isogamous 
      organisms with many self-incompatible mating types. We assume that a nuclear locus 
      determines the mating type of gametes and that another nuclear locus controls the 
      digestion of mitochondria DNAs (mtDNAs) of the recipient gamete after fusion. We 
      then examine the coupled genetic dynamics for the evolution of self-incompatible 
      mating types and biased mitochondrial transmission between them. In Physarum, a 
      multiallelic nuclear locus matA controls both the mating type of the gametes and the 
      selective elimination of the mtDNA in the zygotes. We theoretically examine two 
      potential mechanisms that might be responsible for the preferential digestion of 
      mitochondria in the zygote. In the first model, the preferential digestion of 
      mitochondria is assumed to be the outcome of differential expression levels of a 
      suppressor gene carried by each gamete (suppression-power model). In the second 
      model (site-specific nuclease model), the digestion of mtDNAs is assumed to be due 
      to their cleavage by a site-specific nuclease that cuts the mtDNA at unmethylated 
      recognition sites. Also assumed is that the mtDNAs are methylated at the same 
      recognition site prior to the fusion, thereby being protected against the nuclease 
      of the same gamete, and that the suppressor alleles convey information for the 
      recognition sequences of nuclease and methylase. In both models, we found that a 
      linear dominance hierarchy evolves as a consequence of the buildup of a strong 
      linkage disequilibrium between the mating-type locus and the suppressor locus, 
      though it fails to evolve if the recombination rate between the two loci is larger 
      than a threshold. This threshold recombination rate depends on the number of mating 
      types and the degree of fitness reduction in the heteroplasmic zygotes. If the 
      recombination rate is above the threshold, suppressor alleles are equally 
      distributed in each mating type at evolutionary equilibrium. Based on the 
      theoretical results of the site-specific nuclease model, we propose that a nested 
      subsequence structure in the recognition sequence should underlie the linear 
      dominance hierarchy of mitochondrial transmission.

TI  - The purification of ribosomal RNA gene chromatin from Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 10725-33
AB  - We have undertaken the purification of ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) chromatin from the 
      slime mold Physarum polycephalum, in order to study its chromatin structure. In this 
      organism rDNA exists in nucleoli as highly repeated minichromosomes, and one can 
      obtain crude chromatin fractions highly enriched in rDNA from isolated nucleoli. We 
      first developed a nucleolar isolation method utilizing polyamines as stabilization 
      agents that results in a chromatin fraction containing far more protein than is 
      obtained by the more commonly used divalent cation isolation methods. The latter 
      method appears to result in extensive histone loss during chromatin isolations. Two 
      methods were then used for purifying rDNA chromatin from nucleoli isolated by the 
      polyamine procedure. We found that rDNA chromatin migrates as a single band in 
      agarose gels, well separated from other components in the chromatin preparation. 
      Although the utility of this technique is somewhat limited by low yields and by 
      progressive stripping of protein from rDNA chromatin, it can provide useful 
      information about rDNA chromatin protein composition. The application of this 
      technique to the fractionation of gene and spacer chromatin fragments produced by 
      restriction enzyme digestion is discussed. We also found that rDNA chromatin, if 
      RNase-treated, bands discretely in metrizamide equilibrium density gradients with a 
      density lighter than that of non-nucleolar chromatin. These characteristics suggest 
      that we have identified a transcriptionally active rDNA chromatin fraction which 
      possesses a lower protein to DNA ratio than does non-nucleolar chromatin. This 
      technique yields sufficient purified rDNA chromatin for further biochemical studies 
      and does not cause extensive protein stripping. The procedures developed here should 
      be applicable to the analysis of a variety of chromatin fractions in other systems.

TI  - Stored messenger ribonucleoprotein particles in differentiated sclerotia of Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 177-87
AB  - Starvation induces vegetative microplasmodia of Physarum polycephalum to 
      differentiate into translationally-dormant sclerotia. The existence and the 
      biochemical nature of stored mRNA in sclerotia is examined in this report. The 
      sclerotia contain about 50% of the poly (A)-containing RNA [poly(A)+RNA] complement 
      of microplasmodia as determined by [3H]-poly(U) hybridization. The sclerotial 
      poly(A)+RNA sequences are associated with proteins in a ribonucleoprotein complex 
      [poly(A)+mRNP] which sediments more slowly than the polysomes. Sclerotial 
      poly(A)+RNP sediments more rapidly than poly(A)+RNP derived from the polysomes of 
      microplasmodia despite the occurrence of poly(A)+RNA molecules of a similar size in 
      both particles suggesting the existence of differences in protein composition. 
      Isolation of poly(A)+RNP by oligo (dT)-cellulose chromatography and the analysis of 
      its associated proteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis show that sclerotial 
      poly(A)+RNP contains at least 14 major polypeptides, 11 of which are different in 
      electrophoretic mobility from the polypeptides found in polysomal poly(A)+RNP. Three 
      of the sclerotial poly(A)+RNP polypeptides are associated with the poly(A) sequence 
      (18, 46, and 52 x 10(3) mol. wt. components), while the remaining eight are 
      presumably bound to non-poly(A) portions of the poly(A)+RNA. Although distinct from 
      polysomal poly(A)+RNP, the sclerotial poly(A)+RNP is similar in sedimentation 
      behavior and protein composition (with two exceptions) to the microplasmodial free 
      cytoplasmic poly(A)+RNP. The results suggest that dormant sclerotia store mRNA 
      sequences in association with a distinct set of proteins and that these proteins are 
      similar to those associated with the free cytoplasmic poly(A)+RNP of vegetative 
      plasmodia.

TI  - Influence of different freeze-fracture pretreatments on the fine structure of 
      Physarum polycephalum. A freeze-fracture and freeze-substitution study.
PG  - 667-77
AB  - The influence of different fixatives (glutaraldehyde, osmium, osmium/glutaraldehyde, 
      and osmium/mercuric chloride) and freeze-protecting agents (glycerol and sucrose) on 
      the fine-structural preservation of micro- and macroplasmodia of the acellular slime 
      mold Physarum polycephalum was investigated in both freeze-substituted and 
      freeze-fractured material. Glutaraldehyde fixation and subsequent infiltration with 
      glycerol or sucrose caused severe destruction in the morphology of plasmodial 
      strands and protoplasmic drops, whereas osmium- or osmium/mercuric chloride fixation 
      prevented the formation of normal fracture planes running through the hydrophobic 
      core of the plasma membranes. A short prefixation in a mixture of 
      osmium/glutaraldehyde followed by postfixation in glutaraldehyde delivered the most 
      satisfactory results in the preservation of the fine structure. For comparison, the 
      distribution of integrated membrane particles (IMP) was analysed in freeze-fracture 
      replicas of unfixed controls as well as glutaraldehyde- and 
      osmium/glutaraldehyde-fixed specimens by evaluating the number of IMP per 1 
      micrometer 2 in two different plasmodial regions; in the peripheral plasmalemma and 
      in the central plasmalemmal invaginations. In controls not receiving chemical 
      pretreatment and in specimens fixed with osmium/glutaraldehyde, the central 
      plasmalemmal invaginations showed a clearly reduced total amount of IMP (exoplasmic 
      + protoplasmic fracture face: about 3100) as compared with the peripheral plasma 
      membrane (about 3700). In addition both membrane systems were characterized by an 
      asymmetrical distribution of IMP between the protoplasmic fracture face (PF) and the 
      exoplasmic fracture face (EF): the PF:EF ratio (particle partition coefficient) in 
      the peripheral plasma membrane is the same in controls and in 
      osmium/glutaraldehyde-fixed specimens (2.4:1 and 2.5:1, respectively), whereas the 
      PF:EF ratio in the central plasmalemmal invaginations is 1.5:1 in controls and 3.5:1 
      in fixed specimens. This shows that the membrane of the central plasmalemmal 
      invaginations is more sensitive to chemical fixation than the peripheral 
      plasmalemma. The results point to differences in the physiological properties and 
      functions between the plasmalemma of the cell periphery and the plasmalemma of the 
      invagination system.

TI  - Calcium inhibition as an intracellular signal for actin-myosin interaction.
PG  - 478-498
AB  - Intracellular signaling pathways include both the activation and the inhibition of 
      biological processes. The activation of Ca(2+) regulation of actin-myosin 
      interactions was examined first, whereas it took 20 years for the author to clarify 
      the inhibitory mode by using Physarum polycephalum, a lower eukaryote. This review 
      describes the investigation of the inhibitory mode since 1980. The inhibitory effect 
      of Ca(2+) on myosin was detected chemically by ATPase assays and mechanically by in 
      vitro motility assays. The Ca(2+)-binding ability of Physarum myosin is as high as 
      that of scallop myosin. Ca(2+) inhibits Physarum myosin, whereas it activates 
      scallop myosin. We cloned cDNA of the myosin heavy chain and light chains to express 
      a hybrid of Physarum and scallop myosin, and found that the Ca-binding light chain 
      (CaLc), which belongs to an alkali light chain class, plays a major role in Ca 
      inhibition. The role of CaLc was confirmed by mutating its EF-hand, Ca-binding 
      structure and expressing Physarum myosin as a recombinant protein. Thus, the data 
      obtained by classical protein purification were confirmed by the results obtained 
      with the modern recombinant techniques. However, there are some discrepancies that 
      remain to be solved as described in Section XII.

TI  - The nucleolar protein, B-36, contains a glycine and dimethylarginine-rich sequence 
      conserved in several other nuclear RNA-binding proteins.
PG  - 1278-83
AB  - The amino terminal sequence of the 34 kD nucleolar protein B-36 isolated from the 
      slime mold Physarum polycephalum has been determined. This portion of B-36 is rich 
      in glycine, phenylalanine and the modified amino acid asymmetrical dimethylarginine 
      (DMA) and is 65% identical to that for fibrillarin, a similar and potentially 
      homologous 34 kD nucleolar protein from rat. The terminus of B-36 contains an 
      interesting nine amino acid sequence, Gly-DMA-Gly-Gly-Phe-Gly-Gly-DMA-Gly, which is 
      precisely repeated three times in the 110 kD nucleolar protein nucleolin. Similar 
      sequences have also been reported in a yeast nucleolar protein (SSB-1) and several 
      hnRNP proteins (rat A1 and brine shrimp GRP33). The conserved nature of this unusual 
      sequence is suggestive of an important function which may include RNA-binding since 
      several of these proteins share this feature.

TI  - Studies of histidine phosphorylation by a nuclear protein histidine kinase show that 
      histidine-75 in histone H4 is masked in nucleosome core particles and in chromatin.
PG  - 546-50
AB  - Histone H4 is a good substrate in vitro for the protein histidine kinase activity 
      found both in Physarum polycephalum nuclear extracts and in Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
      cell extracts. However, histone H4 in nucleosome core particles is not a substrate 
      for these kinases. Isolated chromatin was also not a substrate for the protein 
      histidine kinase. The results significantly limit possible interpretations of 
      histidine phosphorylation on histone H4 in vivo and provide a new, sharper focus for 
      future work. In addition, a polynucleotide kinase activity was identified in the 
      Physarum extracts.

TI  - Histone acetyltransferase activity during the cell cycle.
PG  - 322-6
AB  - Histone acetyltransferase activity was measured in isolated nuclei during the 
      synchronous cell cycle of the myxomycete Physarum polycephalum. Nuclei were 
      incubated with [14C]acetyl-coenzyme A and an excess of exogenous calf thymus 
      histones. The activity is periodic during the cell cycle; it rises during the 
      S-phase to reach a maximum in the early G2-period with a decline in mid and late G2. 
      Comparison of the pattern of enzyme activity with the in vivo acetylation of 
      histones during the cell cycle reveals that the enzyme activity does not wholly 
      determine the acetylation state, indicating that other factors, including possibly 
      the structural state of chromatin, are responsible for the observed cell cycle 
      pattern of in vivo histone acetylation.

TI  - Cycling aggregation patterns of cytoplasmic F-actin coordinated with oscillating 
      tension force generation.
PG  - 327-44
AB  - Isometric contracting protoplasmic veins of Physarum polycephalum show cycling 
      patterns of cytoplasmic F-actin, dependent on their oscillating contraction 
      behaviour (minute rhythms). The process of fibrillogenesis represents a parallel 
      arrangement of F-actin chains ("plasma filaments, microfilaments") during the 
      isometric contraction phase. A part of the results of the present work corroborates 
      previous results on stretch-activated veins which showed that the fibrillar form of 
      F-actin reflects the isometric contracted state. During isometric relaxation phase, 
      a disaggregation of the fibrillar pattern takes place and is accompanied by a 
      deparallelisation of F-actin chains. Therefore, the isometric relaxed state of 
      cytoplasmic actomyosin is non-fibrillar in nature. Thus, the morphologically 
      detectable fibrillar form of cytoplasmic actomyosin, according to physiological 
      interpretation, is solely representative of the isometric contracted state. The 
      question whether assembly-disassembly processes, e.g. G equilibrium 
      F-actin-transformation, play a role in the contraction-relaxation cycle is 
      discussed.

TI  - Stable, selectable, integrative DNA transformation in Physarum.
PG  - 207-12
AB  - The Physarum polycephalum actin promoter, PardC, can drive transient expression of 
      heterologous genes in Physarum amoebae. The hph gene, encoding hygromycin (Hy) 
      phosphotransferase, can confer resistance to Hy on a broad spectrum of organisms. 
      When PardC is translationally fused to hph and transformed into yeasts on 
      high-copy-number vectors, the yeasts become Hy resistant (HyR), showing that 
      PardC-hph is a functional, selectable genetic element. To establish a stable 
      transformation system for Physarum, we electroporated plasmids bearing PardC-hph 
      into Physarum amoebae and then selected for HyR transformants. We show that HyR 
      amoebae arise upon the stable integration of PardC-hph into the nuclear genome in 
      single copy. These results establish a transformation system that can be used to add 
      plasmid-borne genetic information to Physarum.

TI  - Involvement of actin dephosphorylation in germination of Physarum sclerotium.
PG  - 129-33
AB  - The plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum grows without cytokinesis and shows an 
      active cytoplasmic streaming under wet and nutritious conditions. It can undergo 
      reversible differentiation into several types of dormancy to survive in adverse 
      environments. Temperature change or osmotic stress leads to cytoplasmic division of 
      the plasmodium into cells containing one or more nuclei: these form a macrocyst, the 
      spherule. Desiccation also induces cell division of the plasmodium followed by 
      formation of a sclerotium, a dormant body resistant to dry stress. More than half of 
      the actin in a sclerotium is phosphorylated at a single site, threonine 203, 
      resulting in loss of its ability to polymerize into actin filaments. In the present 
      study, actin phosphorylation was found in the sclerotium but not in either the 
      plasmodium or in the spherule. This result suggests that phosphorylation of 
      sclerotium actin may be related to the mechanism associated with desiccation 
      resistance rather than morphological changes through cell compartmentalization in 
      the macrocyst formation. Moreover. dephosphorylation of the phosphorylated form of 
      sclerotium actin began within 5 min after addition of water. Dephosphorylation was 
      not affected by sucrose and sorbitol sugars, but was inhibited by ammonium 
      bicarbonate, ammonium phosphate, sodium phosphate, NaCl, and KCl in a dose-dependent 
      manner. On the other hand, in germination of the sclerotium there was measurable 
      sensitivity to both carbohydrates and salts. Actin dephosphorylation seems to be one 
      of the important processes in the early phase of sclerotium germination.

AB  - We have tested the hypothesis [Wiegers, Kramer, Klapproth & Hilz (1976) Eur. J. 
      Biochem. 64. 535-540] that the synthesis of rRNA in the nucleolus may have a 
      partially independent supply of nucleoside triphosphates that is not completely 
      suppressed when cells are supplied with exogenous nucleosides. For the slime mould, 
      Physarum polycephalum, and Chinese hamster ovary cells in culture, the specific 
      activities (3H/32P) of UMP and CMP in tRNA, which is synthesised in the nucleoplasm, 
      and rRNA were compared after continuous labelling with [3H]uridine and 
      [32P]phosphate. No differences were found, suggesting that transcription throughout 
      the nucleus draws on a common supply of pyrimidine triphosphates that is uniformly 
      labelled from exogenous [3H]uridine. As a control of the radioactive labelling 
      schedule, a similar experiment was carried out with the prokaryote, Escherichia 
      coli, and identical results were obtained.

TI  - Potassium loss during galvanotaxis of slime mold.
PG  - 567-74
AB  - The posterior reticulated regions of the plasmodia of the slime mold, Physarum 
      polycephalum, whose migration has been oriented by direct current (3.0 to 5.0 
      microa/mm(2) in the agar substrate), contain 30 per cent less potassium than the 
      advancing non-reticulated region. The anterior regions have the same potassium 
      concentration as that of the controls, approximately 32 meq/kg wet weight. 
      Differences in potassium concentration between anterior and posterior regions of 
      control plasmodia, not oriented by electric current, are less than 5 per cent. 
      Sodium, in contrast to potassium, is generally less concentrated in the anterior 
      than in the posterior regions of electrically oriented plasmodia, but sodium 
      concentrations are extremely variable. No significant difference in protein 
      concentration was found between oriented and control plasmodia. Thirty-five per cent 
      of the total potassium, but none of the sodium, is found in acidified ethanol 
      precipitates from plasmodial homogenates. Potassium, but not sodium, appears to be 
      closely associated with processes which differentiate anterior from posterior in an 
      oriented plasmodium.

TI  - Oscillating contractions in protoplasmic strands of Physarum: simultaneous 
      tensiometry of longitudinal and radial rhythms, periodicity analysis and temperature 
      dependence.
PG  - 49-59
AB  - 1. The construction of a 'twin-tension transducer' allows the simultaneous 
      measurement of the same or different contraction rhythms at any selected sites of 
      living plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum. This method has been used to analyse the 
      relation of longitudinal and radial contraction activity within migrating plasmodia 
      and plasmodial veins, under isometric as well as under isotonic conditions of 
      measurement. 2. A periodicity analysis of the oscillating contraction rhythms 
      revealed average period values for the longitudinal contraction cycle of 2-1 min and 
      for the radial contraction cycle of 1-3 min at a temperature of 22 degrees C. 3. The 
      periods of longitudinal contraction depend on the environment of the strands. The 
      mean value under submerged conditions was 2-9 min. 4. The temperature dependences 
      for both longitudinal and radial contraction cycles were determined to provide 
      reliable values for the normal reaction range of the contractile system (cytoplasmic 
      actomyosin). The values for radial contraction activity are 2-0 min at 16 degrees C, 
      1-5 min at 20 degrees C, and 1-2 min at 24 degrees C. The range between 16 degrees 
      and 24 degrees C can be regarded as physiological. 5. The possibility is discussed 
      that only one 'genuine' contraction frequency of cytoplasmic actomyosin exists in 
      Physarum.

TI  - A novel 36,000-dalton actin-binding protein purified from microfilaments in Physarum 
      plasmodia which aggregates actin filaments and blocks actin-myosin interaction.
PG  - 604-14
AB  - In the plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum, which show a cyclic 
      contraction-relaxation rhythm of the gel layer, huge aggregates of entangled actin 
      microfilaments are formed at about the onset of the relaxation (R. Nagai, Y. 
      Yoshimoto, and N. Kamiya. 1978. J. Cell Sci. 33:205-225). By treating the plasmodia 
      with Triton X-100, we prepared a demembranated cytoskeleton consisting of entangled 
      actin filaments and found that the actin filaments hardly interact with rabbit 
      skeletal myosin. From the cytoskeleton we purified a novel actin-binding protein 
      which binds stoichiometrically to actin and makes actin filaments curled and 
      aggregated. It also inhibits the ATPase activity as well as the superprecipitation 
      of reconstituted rabbit skeletal muscle actomyosin. This protein has a polypeptide 
      molecular weight of 36,000 and binds 7 mol of actin/mol 36,000 polypeptide.

TI  - Phalloidin-gold complexes: a new tool for ultrastructural localization of F-actin.
PG  - 1197-202
AB  - We used a phalloidin-gold complex to study the distribution of F-actin in the 
      myxamoebae and macroplasmodia of the slime mold Physarum polycephalum. After 
      incubation of Lowicryl- or Quetol-embedded specimens with this complex, 
      significantly different labeling intensities were found over the various cytoplasmic 
      and nuclear regions of the cells. The nucleoplasm was the most heavily labeled cell 
      compartment, followed in decreasing order of labeling intensity by the cytoplasm, 
      the nucleolus, and the chromocenters. The labeling observed over the latter area did 
      not appear significantly different from that of the background. Sections incubated 
      in the phalloidin-gold complex to which an excess of F-actin was added showed no 
      significant labeling over any of the above-mentioned cell regions. Other control 
      experiments included incubation of the sections with a phalloidin solution followed 
      by the phalloidin-gold complex, PEG-stabilized colloidal gold, and a bovine serum 
      albumin-gold complex. There was no or very little labeling of the preparations.

TI  - Identification of EcoRV fragments spanning the N alpha-tubulin gene of Physarum.
PG  - 229-33
AB  - The N alpha-tubulin gene of Physarum polycephalum has an EcoRV site at codons 
      252/253. EcoRV digestion of physarum DNA generated two EcoRV fragments per gene copy 
      comprising both coding and flanking sequences. Hybridisation probes which included 
      coding sequences upstream from the central EcoRV site cross-hybridised with another 
      alpha-tubulin gene. Probes derived from either 5'- or 3'-flanking regions were 
      gene-specific. These probes identified two EcoRV fragments in the haploid strain 
      CLdAXE viz 5.4 kb (5'-fragment) and 6.2 kb (3'-fragment). The same two fragments 
      were identified in EcoRV digests of DNA of the diploid strain M3CVIII, and a second 
      form of the gene was also identified comprising two fragments viz 5.0 kb (5'-end) 
      and 5.5 kb (3'-end). Both forms gave rise to an identical 4.65 kb HindIII fragment 
      as judged by restriction mapping.

TI  - Site-specific initiation of DNA replication within the non-transcribed spacer of 
      Physarum rDNA.
PG  - 1447-53
AB  - Physarum polycephalum rRNA genes are found on extrachromosomal 60 kb linear 
      palindromic DNA molecules. Previous work using electron microscope visualization 
      suggested that these molecules are duplicated from one of four potential replication 
      origins located in the 24 kb central non-transcribed spacer [Vogt and Braun (1977) 
      Eur. J. Biochem., 80, 557-566]. Considering the controversy on the nature of the 
      replication origins in eukaryotic cells, where both site-specific or delocalized 
      initiations have been described, we study here Physarum rDNA replication by two 
      dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis and compare the results to those obtained by 
      electron microscopy. Without the need of cell treatment or enrichment in replication 
      intermediates, we detect hybridization signals corresponding to replicating rDNA 
      fragments throughout the cell cycle, confirming that the synthesis of rDNA molecules 
      is not under the control of S-phase. The patterns of replication intermediates along 
      rDNA minichromosomes are consistent with the existence of four site-specific 
      replication origins, whose localization in the central non-transcribed spacer is in 
      agreement with the electron microscope mapping. It is also shown that, on a few 
      molecules, at least two origins are active simultaneously.

AB  - A thorough extraction of plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum by sequential treatment 
      with 1% Triton x-100, 0.6 M KI, 4% SDS plus 7 M urea leaves behind an elastic cell 
      ghost, which represents a cytoplasmic matrix protein arranged as a continuous 
      network in all cell regions. The protein is present in the ectoplasm as well as in 
      the endoplasm. The extraction-resistant ghosts reveal filaments 2-3 nm in diameter, 
      perform a conspicuous volume condensation upon the addition of mM-concentrations of 
      di- and trivalent cations and can be partially solubilized in 4.5 M guanidinium 
      chloride plus 25% 2-mercaptoethanol at 70 degrees C. SDS-gel electrophoresis shows a 
      distinct band at 43,000 daltons and a faint high molecular weight component 
      suggesting a similarity to muscle connection.

TI  - Transformation of cytoplasmic actin. Importance for the organization of the 
      contractile gel reticulum and the contraction--relasation cycle of cytoplasmic 
      actomyosin.
PG  - 495-528
AB  - (1) Within the low viscous flowing endoplasm of Physarum polycephalum a considerable 
      amount of actin is in the non-filamentous state. This can be demonstrated by 
      applying poly-L-lysin to surface spreads of native protoplasm. (2) It has been shown 
      that in protoplasmic drops the endoplasm-ectoplasm transformation is accompanied by 
      an actin polymerization from the non-filamentous state to F-actin. (3) The actual 
      state of the labile G-F-actin equilibrium determines the varying consistency 
      (viscosity) of the cytoplasm. (4) Increasing viscosity can be interpreted as being 
      brought about by a) shifting of the G-F-actin equilibrium to the filamentous side, 
      and (b) increased myosin-mediated binding sites between actin filaments. (5) 
      Polymerization and depolymerization processes are involved in the rhythmically 
      occurring contraction-relaxation cycle of cytoplasmic actomyosin in Physarum. (6) 
      Cytoplasmic actin and myosin represent the architectural proteins of the contractile 
      gel reticulum in eukaryotic cells. (7) The importance of the regulation of actin 
      polymerization as a basic control mechanism of the eukaryotic cell is discussed.

TI  - Sequence-specific cleavage of chromatin by staphylococcal nuclease can generate an 
      atypical nucleosome pattern.
PG  - 4121-33
AB  - We have investigated the nucleosomal organization of ribosomal genes in the 
      acellular slime mold Physarum polycephalum. When probed with staphylococcal 
      nuclease, the ribosomal genes appear to be uniformly packed in nucleosomes, in an 
      arrangement which is indistinguishable from the pattern obtained with bulk 
      chromatin. During this study, an unusual pattern of digestion was obtained from a 
      DNA region immediately upstream of the initiation site of rRNA transcription, in 
      addition to the nucleosomal profile, a second regular ladder of fragments with a 
      repeat length of 30-40 basepairs was generated from this region. We established that 
      this pattern of degradation reflects the strong preference of staphylococcal 
      nuclease for certain nucleotide arrangements on the DNA, rather than a particular 
      chromatin configuration. These observations clearly show that great caution needs to 
      be exerted whenever data from staphylococcal nuclease digestions are interpreted in 
      terms of chromatin structure.

TI  - Acetylation of histone H4 and its role in chromatin structure and function.
PG  - 76-9
AB  - Histone h4 is a highly conserved structural component of the nucleosome subunit of 
      chromatin. The activation of chromatin is accompanied by changes in structure which 
      may be caused by histone modification or by interactions of specific non-histone 
      proteins, or both. Histone H4 can be modified by acetylation and this modification 
      has been correlated with chromosome assembly and with transcription. We have now 
      tested these correlations by studying H4 acetate content as a function of the cell 
      cycle using the naturally synchronous cell cycle in Physarum polycephalum. The 
      results show two clear correlations: (1) tetra-acetylated H4 correlates with 
      transcription; (2) highly acetylated H4 (2 to 4 acetates per molecule) is inversely 
      correlated with H1 phosphorylation and initiation of chromosome condensation in 
      prophase. The results are consistent with turnover of di-acetylated H4 during 
      chromosome assembly in S phase.

TI  - Use of specific endonuclease cleavage in RNA sequencing-an enzymic method for 
      distinguishing between cytidine and uridine residues.
PG  - 3441-54
AB  - The extracellular ribonuclease I of the common slime mold physarum polycephalum 
      (RNase Phy1), which has recently been purified to homogeneity, has been used to 
      distinguish between C and U residues in 3'-end-labeled oligoribonucleotides. As 
      shown by Bargetzi and coworkers, this enzyme exhibits strong cleavage preference for 
      U-N over C-N and N-C over N-U bonds. In the present paper, conditions are being 
      detailed, which enable one to deduce the sequences of rather large, pyrimidine-rich, 
      terminally labeled oligonucleotides by partial digestion with RNases U2, A, and 
      Phy1, followed by resolution of the cleavage products by size. The techniques 
      described in this and a previous communication provide a direct means for 
      identifying A, G, C, and U residues in end-labeled polyribonucleotides.

TI  - The characterization of ribosomal RNA gene chromatin from Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 10734-44
AB  - We have isolated ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) chromatin from Physarum polycephalum 
      using a nucleolar isolation procedure that minimizes protein loss from chromatin 
      and, subsequently, either agarose gel electrophoresis or metrizamide gradient 
      centrifugation to purify this chromatin fraction (Amero, S. A., Ogle, R. C., 
      Keating, J. L., Montoya, V. L., Murdoch, W. L., and Grainger, R. M. (1988) J. Biol. 
      Chem. 263, 10725-10733). Metrizamide-purified rDNA chromatin obtained from nucleoli 
      isolated according to the new procedure has a core histone/DNA ratio of 0.77:1. The 
      major core histone classes comigrate electrophoretically with their nuclear 
      counterparts on Triton-acid-urea/sodium dodecyl sulfate two-dimensional gels, 
      although they may not possess the extent of secondary modification evident with the 
      nuclear histones. This purified rDNA chromatin also possesses RNA polymerase I 
      activity, and many other nonhistone proteins, including two very abundant proteins 
      (26 and 38 kDa) that may be either ribonucleoproteins or nucleolar matrix proteins. 
      Micrococcal nuclease digestion of the metrizamide-purified rDNA chromatin produces 
      particles containing 145-base pair DNA fragments identical in length to those in 
      total chromatin and which contain both transcribed and nontranscribed rDNA 
      sequences. Some smaller fragments (30, 70, and 110 base pairs) are also seen, but 
      their sequence content is not known. These particles sediment uniformly at 11 S in 
      sucrose gradients containing 15 mM NaCl, and at 4-11 S in gradients containing 0.35 
      M NaCl. Particles enriched in gene or nontranscribed spacer sequences are not 
      resolved in these sucrose gradients or in metrizamide gradients. Our findings 
      suggest that the rDNA chromatin fraction we have identified contains 
      transcriptionally active genes and that an organized, particle-containing structure 
      exists in active rDNA chromatin.

LID - 10.1007/BF00577809 [doi]
AB  - After experimental rupture, the plasmalemma of protoplasmic droplets and isolated 
      protoplasm ofPhysarum polycephalum regenerates by means of membrane vesiculation. 
      Various (mucus- and food-) vacuoles are responsible for the new formation of the 
      plasmalemma. Immediately after removal of the old plasma membrane, many vacuoles 
      accumulate below the boundary between the protoplasm and the surrounding medium in a 
      region of 5-10 Μ depth. Later some large vacuoles, which are strongly flattened 
      parallel to the surface of the protoplasm, originate by means of successive 
      confluence of these single vesicles. The large vacuoles finally fuse to a single 
      vacuole which surrounds the whole protoplast. Thedistal membrane of this vacuole 
      disintegrates together with degenerating protoplasmic components. Theproximal 
      membrane of the vacuole represents the new surface of the surviving protoplasm. The 
      process of regeneration of the plasmalemma takes 5-6 sec and seems not to depend on 
      the kind of medium surrounding the protoplasm. Inspite of the fact that during a 
      part of the first phase of regeneration, the cytoplasm is "naked" (i.e. without a 
      membranous boundary), there is no migration of particulate substances from the outer 
      medium into the surviving protoplasm, as shown by experiments with the marker 
      substanceaerosil.

TI  - Acetylated alpha-tubulin in Physarum: immunological characterization of the isotype 
      and its usage in particular microtubular organelles.
PG  - 41-9
AB  - We have used monoclonal antibodies specific for acetylated and unacetylated 
      alpha-tubulin to characterize the acetylated alpha-tubulin isotype of Physarum 
      polycephalum, its expression in the life cycle, and its localization in particular 
      microtubular organelles. We have used the monoclonal antibody 6-11B-1 (Piperno, G., 
      and M. T. Fuller, 1985, J. Cell Biol., 101:2085-2094) as the probe for acetylated 
      alpha-tubulin and have provided a biochemical characterization of the monoclonal 
      antibody KMP-1 as a probe for unacetylated tubulin in Physarum. Concomitant use of 
      these two probes has allowed us to characterize the acetylated alpha-tubulin of 
      Physarum as the alpha 3 isotype. We have detected this acetylated alpha 3 tubulin 
      isotype in both the flagellate and in the myxameba, but not in the plasmodium. In 
      the flagellate, acetylated tubulin is present in both the flagellar axonemes and in 
      an extensive array of cytoplasmic microtubules. The extensive arrangement of 
      acetylated cytoplasmic microtubules and the flagellar axonemes are elaborated during 
      the myxameba-flagellate transformation. In the myxameba, acetylated tubulin is not 
      present in the cytoplasmic microtubules nor in the mitotic spindle microtubules, but 
      is associated with the two centrioles of this cell. These findings, taken together 
      with the apparent absence of acetylated alpha-tubulin in the ephemeral microtubules 
      of the plasmodium suggest a natural correspondence between the presence of 
      acetylated alpha-tubulin and microtubule organelles that are intrinsically stable or 
      cross-linked.

TI  - Amine-specificity of the inactivating ornithine decarboxylase modification in 
      Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 551-7
AB  - The enzyme catalysing the polyamine-stimulated modification of Physarum ornithine 
      decarboxylase in vivo was partially purified and its activity on purified ornithine 
      decarboxylase was examined with respect to its specificity for various amines. 
      Spermidine, spermine and several polyamine analogues strongly promoted this reaction 
      in vitro (apparent Km in the 0.1--0.5 mM range), whereas putrescine (apparent Km 
      5.33 mM) and several related diamines were not nearly as effective. In agreement 
      with this, sensitivity studies performed in vivo also suggested that cellular 
      spermidine, and not putrescine, is critical in modulating ornithine decarboxylase 
      activity by this post-translational control. Unlike putrescine, or other diamines, 
      1,3-diaminopropane demonstrated a functional similarity to the polyamines in 
      stimulating this reaction. This study has demonstrated a method whereby 
      non-physiological amines capable of depressing ornithine decarboxylase activity by 
      this natural feedback mechanism can be readily identified for further evaluation of 
      their potential use in the experimental and medical control of polyamine 
      biosynthesis.

AB  - The relationship between protein synthesis and mitosis was studied in Physarum 
      polycephalum, a plasmodial slime mold whose nuclear divisions are synchronous. 
      Results of studies with actidione (cycloheximide), an inhibitor of protein 
      synthesis, indicated that the essential structural proteins for mitosis and nuclear 
      reconstruction were completed prior to the dissolution of the nucleolus in prophase. 
      Proteins that determine the duration of the transition from metaphase to nuclear 
      reconstruction were synthesized from late prophase to prometaphase. It is proposed 
      that these proteins are concerned with the transformation of chemical energy into 
      the mechanical work of mitosis.

TI  - Acceleration-sensitivity threshold of Physarum.
PG  - 239-44
AB  - Free-living cells show distinct gravisensitivities and often use the gravity ('g') 
      vector for their spatial orientation. The rhythmic contractions of the ameboid 
      Myxomycete (acellular slime mold) Physarum polycephalum are a sensitive parameter 
      which can be modified by external stimuli. Space experiments and ground-based 0 x g 
      simulation studies established that the contraction period transiently decreases 
      after a transition from 1 x g to 0 x g with a back-regulating process starting after 
      30 min. For determination of the threshold of acceleration sensitivity, a 
      slow-rotating centrifuge microscope 
      (NIZEMI--Niedergeschwindigkeits-Zentrifugenmikroskop) was used, providing in space 
      accelerations from 0 x g to 1.5 x g. A stepwise acceleration increase revealed that 
      the lowest acceleration level capable of inducing a response was 0.1 x g. The 
      response to the acceleration increase was an increase in contraction period, in 
      contrast to a stimulus deprivation, which led to a period decrease. The time 
      schedule of the acceleration responses and back-regulating process seems to be 
      fixed, suggesting that every acceleration being above the threshold can induce a 
      complete response-regulation process. The low acceleration-sensitivity threshold 
      favors rather large and dense cell organelles as candidates for the gravity receptor 
      in Physarum.

TI  - Purification and characterization of a novel intracellular acid proteinase from the 
      plasmodia of a true slime mold, Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 19898-903
AB  - An acid proteinase was purified to apparent homogeneity from the plasmodia of a 
      slime mold, Physarum polycephalum, by a combination of detergent extraction, acid 
      precipitation, and column chromatographies on DEAE-Sephadex, hydroxylapatite, 
      CM-Sephadex, and Sephadex G-100. The enzyme was shown to be composed of two 
      polypeptide chains (a 31-kDa heavy chain and a 23-kDa light chain) cross-linked by 
      disulfide bond(s). The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the heavy chain was 
      determined to be Ala-Gly-Val- 
      Asp-Gly-Tyr-Ile-Val-Pro-Tyr-Val-Ile-Phe-Asp-Leu-Tyr-Gly-Ile-Pro-Tyr and that of the 
      light chain to be Ala-Glu-Pro-Pro-Ile. The heavy chain contained carbohydrate moiety 
      composed of mannose, glucosamine, fucose, and glucose. The enzyme was optimally 
      active at pH 1.7 toward hemoglobin as a substrate. Among the proteinase inhibitors 
      tested only diazoacetyl-D,L-norleucine methyl ester, a typical aspartic proteinase 
      inhibitor, inhibited the acid proteinase in the presence of cupric ions. It was 
      insensitive to the other typical aspartic proteinase inhibitors, pepstatin A and 
      1,2-epoxy-3-(p-nitrophenoxy)propane. The enzyme hydrolyzed 
      Lys-Pro-Ile-Glu-Phe(4-NO2)-Arg-Leu at the Phe-Phe(4-NO2) bond, but could not 
      hydrolyze another synthetic pepsin-substrate, 
      N-acetyl-L-phenylalanyl-3,5-diiodo-L-tyrosine. The enzyme showed a unique substrate 
      specificity toward oxidized insulin B chain. The major cleavage sites were the bonds 
      Gly8-Ser9, Leu11-Val12, Cya19-Gly20, and Phe24-Phe25, and the Gly8-Ser9 bond was 
      most susceptible. These results indicate that the enzyme is a novel type of 
      intracellular acid proteinase with a unique substrate specificity.

TI  - Structure and evolution of myxomycete nuclear group I introns: a model for 
      horizontal transfer by intron homing.
PG  - 297-304
AB  - We have examined five nuclear group I introns, located at three different positions 
      in the large subunit ribosomal RNA (LSU rRNA) gene of the two myxomycete species, 
      Didymium iridis and Physarum polycephalum. Structural models of intron RNAs, 
      including secondary and tertiary interactions, are proposed. This analysis revealed 
      that the Physarum intron 2 contains an unusual core region that lacks the P8 
      segment, as well as several of the base-triples known to be conserved among group I 
      introns. Structural and evolutionary comparisons suggest that the corresponding 
      introns 1 and 2 were present in a common ancestor of Didymium and Physarum, and that 
      the five introns in LSU rRNA genes of these myxomycetes were acquired in three 
      different events. Evolutionary relationships, inferred from the sequence analysis of 
      several different nuclear group I introns and the ribosomal RNA genes of the 
      intron-harbouring organisms, strongly support horizontal transfer of introns in the 
      course of evolution. We propose a model that may explain how myxomycetes in natural 
      environments obtained their nuclear group I introns.

TI  - A phylogenetic study of U4 snRNA reveals the existence of an evolutionarily 
      conserved secondary structure corresponding to 'free' U4 snRNA.
PG  - 17-28
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of Physarum polycephalum U4 snRNA*** was determined and 
      compared to published U4 snRNA sequences. The primary structure of P polycephalum U4 
      snRNA is closer to that of plants and animals than to that of fungi. But, both fungi 
      and P polycephalum U4 snRNAs are missing the 3' terminal hairpin and this may be a 
      common feature of lower eucaryote U4 snRNAs. We found that the secondary structure 
      model we previously proposed for 'free' U4 snRNA is compatible with the various U4 
      snRNA sequences published. The possibility to form this tetrahelix structure is 
      preserved by several compensatory base substitutions and by compensatory nucleotide 
      insertions and deletions. According to this finding, association between U4 and U6 
      snRNAs implies the disruption of 2 internal helical structures of U4 snRNA. One has 
      a very low free energy, but the other, which represents one-half of the helical 
      region of the 5' hairpin, requires 4 to 5 kcal to be open. The remaining part of the 
      5' hairpin is maintained in the U4/U6 complex and we observed the conservation, in 
      all U4 snRNAs studied, of a U bulge residue at the limit between the helical region 
      which has to be melted and that which is maintained. The 3' domain of U4 snRNA is 
      less conserved in both size and primary structure than the 5' domain; its structure 
      is also more compact in the RNA in solution. In this domain, only the Sm binding 
      site and the presence of a bulge nucleotide in the hairpin on the 5' side of the Sm 
      site are conserved throughout evolution.

TI  - Purification and properties of ornithine decarboxylase from Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 179-83
AB  - Ornithine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.17) has been purified 3,500-fold from the 
      plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum. The purified material exhibited a Km for 
      ornithine of 0.6 mM and Vmax of 20 mumol of CO2 formed per min/mg at 30 degrees C 
      (62 mumol/min/mg at 37 degrees C). It migrated as a single protein and activity 
      species on high pressure liquid chromatography (TSK-3000) in 0.15 M NaCl (Mr = 
      80,000) and in native gels containing 5, 6.5, 8, and 9.5% acrylamide. A single 
      protein band (Mr = 43,000) was observed on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel 
      electrophoresis. Activity was lost upon incubation with alpha-difluoromethyl[5-14C] 
      ornithine, and the inactivated material appeared as a single Mr = 43,000 14C-band on 
      autoradiograms of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The decarboxylase 
      activity was specific for ornithine and was pyridoxal-P-dependent. The Km for 
      pyridoxal-P (10 microM) was identical with the Kd for pyridoxal-P binding determined 
      from the quenching of protein fluorescence (lambda ex = 282 nm, lambda em = 350 nm, 
      maximal quenching 81%). Using specific antibody obtained from rabbit hyperimmune 
      serum as a probe, an Mr = 43,000 immunoreactive species was detected on 
      nitrocellulose blots of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels of plasmodial 
      homogenates and all pooled purification fractions, but no higher molecular weight 
      cross-reactive material was detected.

TI  - Polyphyletic origin of the genus Physarum (Physarales, Myxomycetes) revealed by 
      nuclear rDNA mini-chromosome analysis and group I intron synapomorphy.
PG  - 166
LID - 10.1186/1471-2148-12-166 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Physarales represents the largest taxonomic order among the plasmodial 
      slime molds (myxomycetes). Physarales is of particular interest since the two 
      best-studied myxomycete species, Physarum polycephalum and Didymium iridis, belong 
      to this order and are currently subjected to whole genome and transcriptome 
      analyses. Here we report molecular phylogeny based on ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences 
      that includes 57 Physarales isolates. RESULTS: The Physarales nuclear rDNA sequences 
      were found to be loaded with 222 autocatalytic group I introns, which may complicate 
      correct alignments and subsequent phylogenetic tree constructions. Phylogenetic 
      analysis of rDNA sequences depleted of introns confirmed monophyly of the Physarales 
      families Didymiaceae and Physaraceae. Whereas good correlation was noted between 
      phylogeny and taxonomy among the Didymiaceae isolates, significant deviations were 
      seen in Physaraceae. The largest genus, Physarum, was found to be polyphyletic 
      consisting of at least three well supported clades. A synapomorphy, located at the 
      highly conserved G-binding site of L2449 group I intron ribozymes further supported 
      the Physarum clades. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide molecular relationship of 
      Physarales genera, species, and isolates. This information is important in further 
      interpretations of comparative genomics nd transcriptomics. In addition, the result 
      supports a polyphyletic origin of the genus Physarum and calls for a reevaluation of 
      current taxonomy.

TI  - Distinct replication-independent and -dependent phases of histone gene expression 
      during the Physarum cell cycle.
PG  - 1933-7
AB  - During the S phase of the cell cycle, histone gene expression and DNA replication 
      are tightly coupled. In mitotically synchronous plasmodia of the myxomycete Physarum 
      polycephalum, which has no G1 phase, histone mRNA synthesis begins in mid-G2 phase. 
      Although histone gene transcription is activated in the absence of significant DNA 
      synthesis, our data demonstrate that histone gene expression became tightly coupled 
      to DNA replication once the S phase began. There was a transition from the 
      replication-independent phase to the replication-dependent phase of histone gene 
      expression. During the first phase, histone mRNA synthesis appears to be under 
      direct cell cycle control; it was not coupled to DNA replication. This allowed a 
      pool of histone mRNA to accumulate in late G2 phase, in anticipation of future 
      demand. The second phase began at the end of mitosis, when the S phase began, and 
      expression became homeostatically coupled to DNA replication. This homeostatic 
      control required continuing protein synthesis, since cycloheximide uncoupled 
      transcription from DNA synthesis. Nuclear run-on assays suggest that in P. 
      polycephalum this coupling occurs at the level of transcription. While histone gene 
      transcription appears to be directly switched on in mid-G2 phase and off at the end 
      of the S phase by cell cycle regulators, only during the S phase was the level of 
      transcription balanced with the rate of DNA synthesis.

TI  - Interaction between cell shape and contraction pattern in the Physarum plasmodium.
PG  - 195-204
AB  - The relationship between cell shape and rhythmic contractile activity in the large 
      amoeboid organism Physarum polycephalum was studied. The organism develops intricate 
      networks of veins in which protoplasmic sol moved to and fro very regularly. When 
      migrating on plain agar, the plasmodium extends like a sheet and develops dendritic 
      veins toward the rear. After a particular stimulation, the vein organization changes 
      into veinless or vein-network structures. In both structures, the mixing rate of the 
      protoplasm, which is related to communication among contraction oscillators, 
      decreased compared with that of the dendritic one. Accompanying these changes in 
      vein structure, the spatio-temporal pattern of the rhythmic contraction changed into 
      a small-structured pattern from a synchronized one. In the above process, cell shape 
      affects the contraction pattern, but, conversely, the contraction pattern effects 
      the cell shape. To demonstrate this, a phase difference in the rhythmic contraction 
      was induced artificially by entraining the intrinsic rhythm to external temperature 
      oscillations. New veins then formed along the direction parallel to the phase 
      difference of the rhythm. Consequently, the vein organization of the cell interacts 
      with the contractile activity to form a feedback loop in a mechanism of contraction 
      pattern formation.

TI  - Oscillatory contraction activity in Physarum.
PG  - 15-32
AB  - The plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum show different oscillatory phenomena (time 
      period approximately 1.3 min) in their contraction behaviour and their protoplasmic 
      flow. The force generating system for these phenomena is cytoplasmic actomyosin. The 
      biochemical nature and location(s) of the oscillator(s), i.e. the clock governing 
      these phenomena are unknown. The following locations are discussed as possible sites 
      of the oscillator: (1) cytoplasmic actomyosin, (2) the energy supply system, (3) 
      inner Ca2+ stores, and (4) the plasmalemma, which must be involved at least in 
      modulating the force generated by the contractile machinery during a chemotactic 
      response. The following oscillatory phenomena were used to assess the effects of 
      externally and internally applied substances (e.g. calcium antagonistic drugs, 
      caffeine, D2O) on oscillating force output: (1) persistance of longitudinal 
      contractile activity of veins (for external application of test substances), (2) 
      persistance of radial activity of veins (for internal application of the test 
      substances), (3) de novo generation of contractile activity in protoplasmic drops 
      (external application). The data seem to exclude rhythmical Ca2+, Na+ or K+ 
      transport across the plasmalemma as a triggering function for the oscillation. 
      Contractile activity seems to represent a spontaneous, endogeneous oscillation which 
      can be modulated via the plasmalemma during chemotaxis.

AB  - A heterotic, or hybrid, computation implies that two or more substrates of different 
      physical nature are merged into a single device with indistinguishable parts. These 
      hybrid devices then undertake coherent acts on programmable and sensible processing 
      of information. We study the potential of heterotic computers using slime mould 
      acting under the guidance of chemical, mechanical and optical stimuli. Plasmodium of 
      acellular slime mould Physarum polycephalum is a gigantic single cell visible to the 
      unaided eye. The cell shows a rich spectrum of behavioural morphological patterns in 
      response to changing environmental conditions. Given data represented by chemical or 
      physical stimuli, we can employ and modify the behaviour of the slime mould to make 
      it solve a range of computing and sensing tasks. We overview results of laboratory 
      experimental studies on prototyping of the slime mould morphological processors for 
      approximation of Voronoi diagrams, planar shapes and solving mazes, and discuss 
      logic gates implemented via collision of active growing zones and tactile responses 
      of P. polycephalum. We also overview a range of electronic components--memristor, 
      chemical, tactile and colour sensors-made of the slime mould.

TI  - Methylation is co-ordinated on the putative replication origins of Physarum 
      ribosomal DNA.
PG  - 889-901
AB  - In Physarum polycephalum, the ribosomal DNA is found as 60,000 base-pair 
      palindromes. Each rDNA has four symmetrically arranged replication origins flanked 
      by ribosomal RNA genes. A particular sequence, the putative replication origin, is 
      repeated at the approximate position of each origin and nowhere else in the 
      molecule. On a typical rDNA molecule, only one origin is active per replication 
      cycle. We show that both the level and co-ordination of methylation result in 
      asymmetrically methylated rDNA molecules that are particularly hypomethylated at one 
      of their four putative replication origins. This pattern of methylation on a typical 
      rDNA molecule is consistent with a model where hypomethylation is a determinant of 
      origin activity.

TI  - Transcription of alpha-tubulin and histone H4 genes begins at the same point in the 
      Physarum cell cycle.
PG  - 1666-70
AB  - In naturally synchronous plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum, both tubulin and 
      histone gene transcription define periodic cell cycle-regulated events. Using a 
      slot-blot hybridization assay and Northern blot analysis, we have demonstrated that 
      a major peak of accumulation of both alpha-tubulin and histone H4 transcripts occurs 
      in late G2 phase. Nuclear transcription assays indicate that both genes are 
      transcriptionally activated at the same point in the cell cycle: mid G2 phase. While 
      the rate of tubulin gene transcription drops sharply at the M/S-phase boundary, the 
      rate of histone gene transcription remains high through most of S phase. We conclude 
      that the cell cycle regulation of tubulin expression occurs primarily at the level 
      of transcription, while histone regulation involves both transcriptional and 
      posttranscriptional controls. It is possible that the periodic expression of both 
      histone and tubulin genes is triggered by a common cell cycle regulatory mechanism.

TI  - Patterns of tubulin isotype synthesis and usage during mitotic spindle morphogenesis 
      in Physarum.
PG  - 272-81
AB  - Tubulin synthesis in the naturally synchronous plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum 
      is a markedly periodic event restricted to the late G2 period of the cell cycle. 
      Mitosis in the plasmodium is intranuclear, and there are no cytoplasmic microtubules 
      at any stage of the cell cycle. We have combined a biochemical investigation of the 
      synthesis of the plasmodial tubulin isotypes and their participation in the mitotic 
      spindle with a microscopic study (immunofluorescence) of the development of spindle 
      microtubules throughout the cell cycle. We have shown that all four tubulin isotypes 
      identified in the plasmodium (alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 1 and beta 2) are present in 
      the mitotic spindle. The stoichiometry of isotype usage in the mitotic spindle 
      generally reflects the overall abundance of isotypes in the plasmodium as a whole: 
      beta 2 greater than alpha 1 greater than alpha 2 greater than beta 1. We have also 
      shown that tubulins synthesized in the G2 period of one cell cycle can be 
      incorporated into the spindles of the immediately ensuing mitosis and have 
      sufficient biological longevity to allow participation in the mitotic divisions of 
      future cell cycles. Thus, the phenomenon of periodic tubulin synthesis does not 
      reflect a restricted use of tubulin to the cell cycle in which it was synthesized. 
      The major polymerization of tubulin in the nucleus occurred less than 30 min before 
      metaphase. A novel tubulin-containing structure was, however, present in the nucleus 
      approximately 60 min before metaphase. Polymerized tubulin is rapidly removed from 
      the nucleus following nucleokinesis.

TI  - Physarum thymidine kinase. A step or a peak enzyme depending upon temperature of 
      growth.
PG  - 177-81
AB  - The variations of thymidine kinase or ATP:thymidine 5'-phosphotransferase (EC 
      2.7.1.21) during the cell cycle of Physarum polycephalum plasmodia have been studied 
      at two extreme physiological temperatures: 22 degrees C and 32 degrees C. At 22 
      degrees C the enzyme activity increases near mitosis and stays constant during late 
      S and G2 phases, exhibiting the typical pattern of a 'step enzyme'. But at 32 
      degrees C thymidine kinase activity goes through a maximum 1 h 30 min after mitosis 
      and decreases during the subsequent phases as expected for a 'peak enzyme'. The rate 
      of enzyme degradation and/or inactivation, measured in the presence of metabolic 
      poisons (cycloheximide or dinitrophenol), appears to follow a simple exponential 
      function with a half-life of approximately 3 h and 1 h at 22 degrees C and 32 
      degrees C respectively. The effect of growth temperature on the decrease of 
      thymidine kinase activity can account entirely for the differences in the pattern of 
      enzyme activity at the two extreme temperatures. Tentative calculations indicate 
      that the rate of enzyme synthesis is nearly constant during the cell cycle except 
      near mitosis, where it is temporarily increased. The results suggest the existence 
      of a regulatory mechanism able to modulate the rate of synthesis of thymidine kinase 
      during the cell cycle.

PG  - 57-67
LID - 10.1039/b706317m [doi]
AB  - We review how soft matter is self-organized to perform information processing at the 
      cell level by examining the model organism Physarum plasmodium. The amoeboid 
      organism, Physarum polycephalum, in the class of true slime molds, exhibits the 
      intelligent behavior of foraging in complex situations. When placed in a maze with 
      food sources at two exits, the organism develops tubular structures with its body 
      which connect the food sources along the shortest path so that the rates of nutrient 
      absorption and intracellular communication are maximized. This intelligent behavior 
      results from the organism's control of a dynamic network through which mechanical 
      and chemical information is transmitted. We review experimental studies that explore 
      the development and adaptation of structures that make up the network. Recently a 
      model of the dynamic network has been developed, and we review the formulation of 
      this model and present some key results. The model captures the dynamics of existing 
      networks, but it does not answer the question of how such networks form initially. 
      To address the development of cell shape, we review existing mechanochemical models 
      of the protoplasm of Physarum, present more general models of motile cells, and 
      discuss how to adapt existing models to explore the development of intelligent 
      networks in Physarum.

TI  - Analysis of Physarum proteins throughout the cell cycle by two-dimensional PAGE.
PG  - 533-40
AB  - The accumulation of several hundred proteins during the nuclear division cycle of 
      Physarum polycephalum was measured by digital image processing of silver-stained 
      two-dimensional (2D) polyacrylamide gels. In contrast to previous studies, we have 
      used an organism with a naturally synchronous cell cycle, so there are no 
      uncertainties concerning synchronization artifacts or cell-sorting artifacts, and we 
      have measured the specific amounts of each protein rather than the rate of 
      synthesis. Since one-dimensional SDS-PAGE shows no significant fluctuations in the 
      most abundant plasmodial proteins, we have loaded 2D gels so that proteins of 
      low-to-moderate abundance appear in the linear range of the silver stain standard 
      curve. Only five proteins showed reproducible, measureable fluctuations during the 
      cell cycle. One of these proteins was tubulin. Full quantitative information was 
      obtained by analysing the digital images of silver-stained gels by a general image 
      processing system.

TI  - Cell cycle dependent association of c-myc protein with the nuclear matrix.
PG  - 29-35
AB  - We demonstrate the presence of a c-myc protein with an apparent molecular weight of 
      67 kd in the lower eukaryote Physarum polycephalum with polyclonal and monoclonal 
      anti-c-myc-antibodies. It is shown that the amount of myc protein present in the 
      nucleus does not fluctuate during the naturally synchronous cell cycle of Physarum. 
      The myc protein remains firmly associated with the nuclear matrix after a variety of 
      matrix preparation procedures. Although the level of c-myc protein is invariant 
      during the cell cycle, the matrix-bound portion of c-myc protein is higher during 
      S-phase as compared to G2-period. In immunoelectron microscopy the immunosignal was 
      considerably stronger in the nuclear matrix compared with unfractionated nuclei, 
      indicating increased accessibility of c-myc protein in nuclear scaffold structures. 
      We show that the nuclear localization of c-myc protein changes during the cell 
      cycle, being transiently but specifically bound to the periphery of the nuclear 
      matrix structure during S-phase.

TI  - Effects of low temperature and calcium on microfilament structure in flagellates of 
      Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 461-72
AB  - Microfilament structures of the ridge and the backbone in Physarum flagellates 
      disintegrated selectively within a few minutes upon cooling by ice-water. The 
      elongated cells concurrently rounded up to spherical or irregular and amoeboid 
      shape. When such rounded cells were warmed to 25 degrees C, the microfilament 
      structures were reconstructed within 1 min and cells subsequently returned to an 
      elongated shape. Disruption of microfilaments by cytochalasin A also caused the 
      rounding up of cells, indicating that the rounding up resulted from disintegration 
      of microfilament structures. This transformation induced by the cold treatment was 
      retarded by preincubation of the cells with EGTA for 15 min, but addition of EGTA 
      immediately before the onset of the cold treatment was less effective. The effect of 
      EGTA was cancelled by simultaneous addition of excess Ca2+. Addition of procaine 
      also inhibited the transformation induced by the cold treatment, while caffeine 
      inhibited the recovery of the elongated shape when returned to 25 degrees C. 
      Furthermore, addition of A23187 at 25 degrees C in the presence of Ca2+ mimicked the 
      effect of the cold treatment. Thus, intracellular release of Ca2+ was suggested to 
      be involved in the transformation induced by the cold treatment. Lability of the 
      microfilament structures at a high concentration of Ca2+ was directly proved using 
      Triton-permeabilized cells. Therefore we concluded that low temperature disrupts 
      microfilament structures that are necessary for the maintenance of the elongated 
      cell shape by inducing intracellular Ca2+ release. However, microfilament structures 
      in Physarum amoeba cells were affected neither by the cold treatment nor by high 
      Ca2+ concentration.

TI  - A Method for Growing Bio-memristors from Slime Mold.
LID - 10.3791/56076 [doi]
LID - 56076
AB  - Our research is aimed at gaining a better understanding of the electronic properties 
      of organisms in order to engineer novel bioelectronic systems and computing 
      architectures based on biology. This specific paper focuses on harnessing the 
      unicellular slime mold Physarum polycephalum to develop bio-memristors (or 
      biological memristors) and bio-computing devices. The memristor is a resistor that 
      possesses memory. It is the 4th fundamental passive circuit element (the other three 
      are the resistor, the capacitor, and the inductor), which is paving the way for the 
      design of new kinds of computing systems; e.g., computers that might relinquish the 
      distinction between storage and a central processing unit. When applied with an AC 
      voltage, the current vs. voltage characteristic of a memristor is a pinched 
      hysteresis loop. It has been shown that P. polycephalum produces pinched hysteresis 
      loops under AC voltages and displays adaptive behavior that is comparable with the 
      functioning of a memristor. This paper presents the method that we developed for 
      implementing bio-memristors with P. polycephalum and introduces the development of a 
      receptacle to culture the organism, which facilitates its deployment as an 
      electronic circuit component. Our method has proven to decrease growth time, 
      increase component lifespan, and standardize electrical observations.

TI  - Immunocytochemistry of the acellular slime mold Physarum polycephalum. V. 
      Cryosectioning now allows analysis of non-extracted plasmodia of any and all stages.
PG  - 1-7
AB  - The spatial distribution of cytoplasmic actin in endoplasmic drops as well as in 
      plasmodial strands can be demonstrated in cryosections by fluorescently labelled 
      phallotoxins and actin antibodies. Our results on cryosections show an identical 
      fibrillar actin distribution as revealed in semithin sections after conventional 
      fixation and embedding. Thus, it is now possible to apply immunocytochemical 
      analysis to any and all plasmodial stages with or without prior fixation and without 
      using extraction procedures. Consequentially the loss of soluble compounds during 
      processing is avoided. The most protective pretreatment of the living specimens 
      before freezing is a 15 min incubation in 1.5 M sucrose containing 50 mM KCl, 10 mM 
      EGTA and 10 mM PIPES buffer, pH 7.0, at 4 degrees C.

TI  - Tubulin proteins and RNA during the myxamoeba-flagellate transformation of Physarum 
      polycephalum.
PG  - 1706-11
AB  - Physarum myxamoebae can be reversibly induced to become flagellates. Physarum 
      flagellates contain a new form of tubulin, alpha 3, that is not found in 
      nonflagellated cells. Evidence is presented that suggests that alpha 3 tubulin 
      arises through posttranslational modification of a preexisting alpha tubulin. 
      Pulse-chase experiments showed that labeled alpha 3 tubulin could be detected when 
      flagellates formed after a chase. RNA was isolated from myxamoebae at different 
      times after induction of flagellum formation. When this RNA was translated in vitro, 
      the resulting products contained no alpha 3 tubulin, also consistent with alpha 3 
      being made by posttranslational modification. Levels of alpha and beta tubulin RNA 
      increased with the proportion of flagellates in the culture. These elevated tubulin 
      RNA levels declined after the number of flagellates in the population achieved 
      plateau values.

TI  - [Calcium inhibition, a new mode for Ca2+ regulation].
PG  - 215-25
AB  - The intracellular concentration of Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) in eukaryotic cells is low under 
      resting conditions. Membrane stimulation can produce a transient increase in [Ca2+]i 
      from submicromolar to micromolar levels. Classically, the effects of elevated 
      [Ca2+]i on eukaryotic cell responses are excitatory: they induce muscle contraction 
      or activate metabolic systems. However, micromolar concentration of Ca2+ has been 
      found to inhibit the actin-myosin-ATP interaction of the lower eukaryote Physarum 
      polycephalum, which is the first example of an effect transiently abolished by 
      elevation of [Ca2+]i in response to extracellular stimulation (Kohama, K.: Trends 
      Pharmacol. Sci. 22, 433-435, 1991). The inhibitory effects on the interaction are 
      closely related to myosin phosphorylation. The activities of kinases to 
      phosphorylate myosin was also inhibited by Ca2+. This article describes the 
      inhibitory mode for Ca2+ regulation of the actomyosin system in Physarum and reviews 
      this inhibitory mode discovered subsequently in many different cell types in both 
      plants and animals.

TI  - Unstable activator models for size control of the cell cycle.
PG  - 617-31
AB  - The unstable activator model of Wheals & Silverman (1982) is extended to account for 
      the delay of nuclear division in the acellular slime mold, Physarum polycephalum, 
      that is caused by pulse treatments with inhibitors of protein synthesis. The model 
      is solved exactly to predict the delay as a function of the half-life of the 
      activator. The Wheals-Silverman model is found to give results comparable, but not 
      superior, to other unstable activator models of the cell cycle.

TI  - Improved negative staining of microfilament arrangements in detergent-extracted 
      Physarum amoeboflagellates.
PG  - 287-93
AB  - A motile, lamellipodium-like structure, the ridge, forms as amoeboflagellate cells 
      of Physarum polycephalum release from a substratum and begin swimming in fluid. 
      Actin microfilaments form a distinct laminar core within the ridge; they are seen as 
      a sparse, disordered meshwork in cytoskeletons prepared by conventional methods 
      using uranyl acetate negative staining [10]. Preservation and visualization of these 
      filaments and their arrangements improved considerably when cytoskeletons were 
      imaged with phosphotungstic acid buffered with ammonium hydroxide (PTA(NH4]. 
      Microfilaments within ridge cytoskeletons were found to form loose bundles and 
      criss-crossing, 'meshwork' arrays several layers deep. Differences could be detected 
      in morphology and detailed arrangement of microfilaments within cytoskeletons 
      prepared in the presence of phalloidin. PTA(NH4) may be useful for studies of 
      cytoskeletal elements and their rearrangements in dynamic, motile regions of cells.

TI  - Molecular analysis of Physarum haemagglutinin I: lack of a signal sequence, sulphur 
      amino acids and post-translational modifications.
PG  - 1077-1084
LID - 10.1099/00221287-144-4-1077 [doi]
AB  - The cDNAs encoding haemagglutinin I from plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum have 
      been cloned using PCR protocols. The composite haemagglutinin I cDNA sequence, 
      derived from several overlapping clones from PCR fragments, spans 408 nt and the 315 
      bp ORF encodes a polypeptide of 104 aa without a typical signal sequence. The 
      putative molecular mass deduced from the amino acid sequence (10,760.76 Da) 
      corresponds exactly to that determined by electrospray ionization MS (10,759.86 +/- 
      0.15 Da), suggesting that haemagglutinin I is not subject to post-translational 
      modification. Haemagglutinin I lacks sulphur amino acids and has a beta-sheet as the 
      major secondary structure. Expression of the coding sequence in Escherichia coli 
      yielded a product that exhibits the same sugar-binding specificity as natural 
      haemagglutinin I. The deduced amino acid sequence shows little similarity to that of 
      any known lectins and thus apparently represents a novel type of lectin.

TI  - Protein tightly bound near the termini of the Physarum extrachromosomal rDNA 
      palindrome.
PG  - 309-14
AB  - The genes coding for ribosomal RNa in plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum are 
      arranged palindromically on extrachromosomal rDNA molecules of 61 kb 
      (kilobasepairs). Incubation of mildly extracted rDNA with the 125I Bolton-Hunter 
      reagent results in incorporation of label not removed by SDS, CsCl, or various 
      organic solvents. Labeled protein is preferentially associated with terminal rDNA 
      restriction fragments, as detected after gel electrophoresis of the DNA. Antibody 
      reaction with dinitrophenylated protein-rDNA complexes allows visualization of 
      protein located from 1 to 2 kb from the termini, in a region containing multiple 
      inverted repeat sequences and single-strand gaps. DNase I treatment of either rDNA 
      or rDNA termini releases primarily two labeled protein bands of 5,000 and 13,000 
      daltons as well as less prominent bands of higher molecular weight. We discuss 
      mechanisms for involvement of terminal protein in replication of 3' ends and 
      chromosomal integration of the rDNA.

TI  - Calcium sensitivity of hybrid complexes of muscle myosin and Physarum proteins.
PG  - 208-21
AB  - 1. A myosin-actin hybrid complex was used to study actin-associated calcium 
      sensitivity of a "cytoplasmic" actomyosin. The approach should be generally 
      applicable. 2. Low salt extracts of Physarum polycephalum contain actin which 
      remains in solution after centrifugation at 46 000 times g or at 100 000 times g for 
      1 h. The actin was precipitated by the addition of muscle myosin to the supernatants 
      and detected in the hybrid complex by electron microscopy, sodium dodecyl sulfate 
      gel analysis, super-precipitation and activation of the myosin ATPase activity. 
      Actin was also precipitable from high speed supernatants of brain tissue or 
      platelets. 3. The hybrid complexes from Physarum possessed 1.5-5-fold calcium 
      dependency which could be removed by washing. Reincubation of the washed complex 
      with concentrated wash solution resulted in high calcium sensitivity. On sodium 
      dodecyl sulfate gels, unwashed complexes from Physarum contained high molecular 
      weight material in addition to bands of molecular weights less than actin. The bands 
      in the size range of 39 000 to 18 000 were primarily lost from the Physarum complex 
      concomitantly with loss of calcium dependence. 4. When the Physarum supernatants 
      were made 40 mM in MgCl2, precipitates were formed containing actin which possessed 
      calcium sensitivity which was also lost on washing with low ionic strength 
      solutions. This calcium dependency was partially reversed by the addition of 
      desensitized rabbit actin to the precipitate before assay. 5. CONCLUSION: calcium 
      regulation of actomyosin in Physarum is mediated primarily by factors that are bound 
      to the actin component. The regulatory factors are soluble in low salt buffers. The 
      molecular weights of the polypeptide chains of several of these factors are similar 
      to those of the troponin polypeptides of striated muscle. In Physarum but not in 
      platelet or brain a prominent polypeptide chain of approx. 55 000 molecular weight 
      also occurs which coprecipitates with the hybrid complex and which is not easily 
      removed.

TI  - Some properties of Physarum actinin. A regulatory protein of actin polymerization.
PG  - 200-15
AB  - A factor termed Physarum actinin was isolated and partially purified from plasmodia 
      of a myxomycete, Physarum polycephalum. When Physarum actinin was mixed with 
      purified Physarum or rabbit striated muscle G-actin in a weight ratio of about 1 
      actinin to 9 actin and then the polymerization of G-actin induced, G-actin 
      polymerized to the ordinary F-actin on addition of 0.1 M KCl. However, it 
      polymerized to Mg-polymer on addition of 2 mM MgCl2. The reduced viscosity (etasp/C) 
      of the Mg-polymer was 1.2 dl/g, about one-seventh of that of the F-actin (7.4 dl/g). 
      The sedimentation coefficient of the Mg-polymer was 22.8 S, almost the same as that 
      of the F-actin (29.4 S). The Mg-polymer showed the specific ATPase activity of the 
      order of 1 . 10(-3) mumol ATP/mg actin per min. It was shown that Physarum actinin 
      copolymerized with G-actin to form Mg-polymer on addition of 2 mM MgCl2. The 
      molecular weights of Physarum actinin were about 90 000 in salt-free or slat 
      solutions and 43 000 in a dodecyl sulfate solution. The range of salting out with 
      ammonium sulfate was 50--65% saturation, which was different from that of Physarum 
      actin (15--35% saturation). Physarum actinin did not interact with Physarum myosin 
      or muscle heavy meromyosin. When the weight ratio of actinin to actin increased, the 
      flow birefringence of the formed Mg-polymer decreased, and it became almost zero at 
      the weight ratio of 1 actinin to 5 actin. ATPase activity reached the maximum level 
      (2.2 . 10(-3) mumol ATP/mg actin per min) at the same ratio. On the addition of 
      Physarum actinin to purified Physarum F-actin which had been polymerized on addition 
      of 2 mM MgCl2 the viscosity decreased rapidly, suggesting that the F-actin filaments 
      were broken in the smaller fragments or that they transformed to Mg-polymers. A 
      factor with properties similar to Physarum actinin was isolated from acetone powder 
      of sea urchin eggs.

TI  - Replication timing of 10 developmentally regulated genes in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 553-66
AB  - We have tested the hypothesis which stipulates that only early-replicating genes are 
      capable of expression. Within one cell type of Physarum - the plasmodium - we 
      defined the temporal order of replication of 10 genes which were known to be 
      variably expressed in 4 different developmental stages of the Physarum life cycle. 
      Southern analysis of density-labeled, bromodesoxyuridine-substituted DNA reveals 
      that 4 genes presumably inactive within the plasmodium, were not restricted to any 
      temporal compartment of S-phase: 1 is replicated in early S-phase, 2 in mid S-phase 
      and 1 in late S-phase. On the other hand, 4 out of 6 active genes analysed are 
      duplicated early, with the first 30% of the genome. Surprisingly, the two others 
      active genes are replicated late in S-phase. By gene-dosage analysis, based on 
      quantitation of hybridization signals from early and late replicating genes 
      throughout S-phase, we could pinpoint the replication of one of these two genes at a 
      stage where 80-85% of the genome has duplicated. Our results demonstrate that late 
      replication during S-phase does not preclude gene activity.

TI  - Characterization of the nucleolar protein, B-36, using monoclonal antibodies.
PG  - 77-93
AB  - A panel of nine monoclonal antibodies has been produced against a major nuclear 
      protein, B-36, purified from the slime mold Physarum polycephalum. B-36, a 34 kD 
      protein biochemically similar to the major structural proteins of mammalian hnRNP 
      particles, was previously shown to be largely associated with the nucleolus. Eight 
      of the monoclonal antibodies are specific for B-36 protein in Physarum and at least 
      three different epitopes are represented among these eight. Using the monoclonal 
      antibodies B-36 has been shown to be localized exclusively to the nucleolus in 
      actively-growing Physarum cultures. The nucleolar localization of B-36 is dependent 
      on the presence of intact RNA, but not DNA, supporting the hypothesis that B-36 is 
      associated with nucleolar RNA, possibly in some analogous manner to the interaction 
      of the related proteins within heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNP) 
      particles. B-36 is apparently a highly conserved nucleolar protein in eukaryotes as 
      all eight of the monoclonal antibodies specific for B-36 in Physarum are also 
      specific for a 34.5 kD nucleolar protein in rat liver. This indicates that a minimum 
      of three distinct epitopes are conserved in B-36 protein from slime mold to rat.

TI  - Mitotic cell cycle control in Physarum. Unprecedented insights via flow-cytometry.
PG  - 57-67
AB  - High resolution flow-cytometric studies of isolated macroplasmodial nuclei of the 
      myxomycete. Physarum polycephalum provide definite evidence for the persistence of 
      natural synchrony at mitosis throughout the entire cell cycle, i.e. completely 
      synchronous DNA replication and traverse of G2. Even if nuclei within a given 
      macroplasmodium belong to two distinct genome size classes (mixoploidy), they cycle 
      and traverse mitosis in strict synchrony. This cannot be explained by current models 
      of regulation of division based solely upon nuclear size and/or nuclear/cytoplasm 
      ratios. Constitutional DNA content variation was apparent among all tested strains, 
      and loss of late-replicating, presumably AT-rich DNA accounts for this variation. A 
      constant duration of the S phase is maintained, irrespective of DNA content, via 
      differential slowdown of replication rates during the 2nd and 3rd hours of 
      replication. A frequently described extension of nuclear replication into G2 could 
      not be substantiated. Interference with DNA and protein synthesis provides the first 
      evidence for a brief "G1 phase" equivalent of 3-4 min duration in asynchronous 
      microplasmodial cultures, and temporally assigns a protein synthesis-dependent 
      "transition point" for completion of mitosis and initiation of DNA synthesis at 5 
      min prior to actual division nuclei which have passed this point at the time of 
      addition of cycloheximide replicate 5% of their DNA before they become arrested. 
      These findings provide strong experimental support for the transition point concept 
      of cell cycle control, and additionally are commensurate with some form of the 
      replicon-set hypothesis in Physarum.

TI  - Rheological properties of living cytoplasm: endoplasm of Physarum plasmodium.
PG  - 1089-97
AB  - Magnetic sphere viscoelastometry, video microscopy, and the Kamiya double chamber 
      method (Kamiya, N., 1940, Science [Wash. DC], 92:462-463.) have been combined in an 
      optical and rheological investigation of the living endoplasm of Physarum 
      polycephalum. The rheological properties examined were yield stress, viscosity (as a 
      function of shear), and elasticity. These parameters were evaluated in directions 
      perpendicular; (X) and parallel (Y) to the plasmodial vein. Known magnetic forces 
      were used for measurements in the X direction, while the falling ball technique was 
      used in the Y direction (Cygan, D.A., and B. Caswell, 1971, Trans. Soc. Rheol. 
      15:663-683; MacLean-Fletcher, S.D., and T.D. Pollard, 1980, J. Cell Biol., 
      85:414-428). Approximate yield stresses were calculated in the X and Y directions of 
      0.58 and 1.05 dyn/cm2, respectively. Apparent viscosities measured in the two 
      directions (eta x and eta y) were found to fluctuate with time. The fluctuations in 
      eta x and eta y were shown, statistically, to occur independently of each other. 
      Frequency correlation with dynamoplasmograms indicated that these fluctuations 
      probably occur independently of the streaming cycle. Viscosity was found to be a 
      complex function of shear, indicating that the endoplasm is non-Newtonian. Plots of 
      shear stress vs. rate of shear both parallel and perpendicular to the vein, showed 
      that endoplasm is not a shear thinning material. These experiments have shown that 
      living endoplasm of Physarum is an anisotropic viscoelastic fluid with a yield 
      stress. The endoplasm appears not to be a homogeneous material, but to be composed 
      of heterogeneous domains.

TI  - Immunocytochemistry of the acellular slime mold Physarum polycephalum. III. 
      Distribution of myosin and the actin-modulating protein (fragmin) in sandwiched 
      plasmodia.
PG  - 179-86
AB  - The acellular slime mold Physarum forms very thin plasmodia when sandwiched between 
      two agar sheets. After extraction with glycerol-containing buffers, suitable objects 
      for immunofluorescence microscopy are obtained, and an analysis of the cytoskeletal 
      and contractile system of Physarum becomes possible. Plasmodia were stained with 
      antibodies against myosin and fragmin, a protein factor involved in actin filament 
      length regulation. The microanatomy and topography of cellular structures containing 
      these proteins were investigated at the light and electron microscopic levels. The 
      patterns obtained with the two antibodies are closely related to those obtained with 
      actin antibody [25]. In both cases the complex system of cytoplasmic fibrils is 
      stained selectively. The fibrils form a more or less regular network in the 
      advancing front zone with the fibrils being interconnected by focal nodes. In the 
      posterior region of the plasmodium, where endoplasmic pathways and protoplasmic 
      veins are differentiated, larger fibrils are detected, running obliquely or 
      longitudinally to the veins. With both antibodies the fluorescent pattern of the 
      fibrils is continuous without indications of periodic interruptions or striations, 
      which would be expected in the case of sarcomere-like subunits. With anti-myosin 
      unstained patches are frequently seen at or close to the nodes of the fibrillar 
      network in the anterior region. The small lobopodia, which are rich in actin, are 
      apparently not stained by the myosin antibody, a result similar to the situation in 
      "ruffling edges¿ of cultured vertebrate cells. Electron microscopic investigations 
      of antibody-labeled fibrils in embedded and sectioned plasmodia allow the 
      identification of antibody molecules at specific sites along the fibrils with a 
      different distribution pattern for each of the two antibodies.

TI  - Comparison of inhibitors of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase from different 
      species.
PG  - 495-502
AB  - S-Adenosyl-L-methionine decarboxylases were purified from rat ventral prostate, 
      yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), slime mould (Physarum polycephalum) and bacteria 
      (Escherichia coli) and tested for inhibition by a variety of nucleosides related to 
      S-adenosylmethionine and by methyl- and ethyl-glyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone). Although 
      the enzymes from these different sources are markedly different with respect to 
      activation by cations, the inhibition by nucleosides was quite similar. Very little 
      inhibition was seen when analogues of S-adenosylmethionine with a different base 
      were tested or when the ribose ring was opened or the positive charge on the sulphur 
      atom was not present. Some derivatives in which the amino acid portion of the 
      molecule was altered were more potent inhibitors, but again there was little 
      difference between the enzymes from different sources. 
      5'-(Dimethylsulphonio)-5'-deoxyadenosine and S-adenosyl-3-methylthiopropylamine were 
      the most inhibitory substances and had similar Ki values, suggesting that the 
      aminopropyl group does not contribute significantly to the binding. All of the 
      S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylases were strongly competitively inhibited by 
      methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) and even more powerfully by its ethyl analogue, 
      although the putrescine-activated enzymes from prostate and yeast were more 
      sensitive than the bacterial and slime-mould enzymes. All of the 
      S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylases tested bound to a column of methylglyoxal 
      bis(guanylhydrazone) linked to Sepharose and were not eluted by 0.5 M-NaCl, but 
      could be released by 1 mM concentrations of the drug, providing a rapid and 
      efficient method for their purification.

TI  - Transient expression of RAD51 in the late G2-phase is required for cell cycle 
      progression in synchronous Physarum cells.
PG  - 755-65
LID - 10.1111/gtc.12174 [doi]
AB  - The homologous recombination factor RAD51 is highly conserved. This criterion 
      enabled us to identify a RAD51 ortholog in Physarum polycephalum. We found that the 
      Physarum protein presents a high homology to the human protein and cross-reacted 
      with antibodies directed against the human RAD51. Taking advantage of the natural 
      synchrony of millions of nuclei within a single cell of Physarum, we investigated 
      the fluctuation of the amount of the PpRAD51 throughout the cell cycle. Our results 
      showed that in the late G2-phase, RAD51 was transiently expressed in a large 
      quantity. Furthermore, knocking-down RAD51 in the G2-phase abolished this transient 
      expression before mitosis and affected cell cycle progression. These results support 
      the idea that RAD51 plays a role in the progression of the cell cycle in the late 
      G2-phase.

PG  - 2644-51
AB  - The actin-binding properties of the actin-fragmin complex from Physarum polycephalum 
      microplasmodia were investigated with respect to regulation by Ca2+, phospholipids, 
      and phosphorylation of the actin subunit by the endogenous actin-fragmin kinase. 
      Fragmin possesses two high affinity actin-binding sites and probably also a third, 
      low affinity site. Its nucleating and F-actin severing activities are inhibited by 
      phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). Actin-fragmin specifically binds PIP2 
      which competes with actin for the Ca(2+)-sensitive site. However, PIP2 cannot 
      dissociate the actin-fragmin complex nor the actin2-fragmin trimer. Efficient 
      F-actin nucleating activity by actin-fragmin is only observed with unphosphorylated 
      actin-fragmin, in the absence of PIP2 and at high Ca2+ (> microM) concentrations. In 
      the presence of PIP2, actin-fragmin only caps actin filaments when unphosphorylated. 
      The results suggest that in the cell, hydrolysis of PIP2, concomitant with the 
      increase of cytosolic Ca2+, could promote subcortical actin polymerization.

AB  - The myxomycetes are a group of primitive phagotrophic eukaryotes characterized by a 
      distinctive plasmodial stage that is well known for its rapid growth rate. In the 
      present study, biomass and lipid production of several different species of 
      myxomycetes were investigated. Physarum polycephalum was found to produce the 
      highest amounts of both dry biomass (1.30g), and lipid (0.143g) per 20mL medium 
      (equal to 65.0g biomass and 7.15g lipid per one liter of medium). Analysis of P. 
      polycephalum lipids by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and fatty acid methyl esters 
      (FAMES) by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) techniques showed that the 
      major lipid type is triglyceride (95.5%), followed by phospholipids (2.6%); 
      diglyceride (0.92%) and monoglyceride (0.92%). Myxomycete lipids consist of three 
      dominant fatty acids: oleic (20%), linoleic (33%), and palmitoleic (17%). These 
      results suggest that P. polycephalum has considerable potential as a source of 
      lipids for biodiesel production.

TI  - ADP-ribosylation of core histones and their acetylated subspecies.
PG  - 607-10
AB  - ADP-ribosylation of core histones was investigated in isolated nuclei of Physarum 
      polycephalum. Core histone species differed in the mode of modification. Whereas 
      ADP-ribosylation of H2A and H2B is sensitive to inhibition by 3-methoxybenzamide, as 
      with most other nuclear acceptor proteins, the modification of H3 and H4 is not 
      inhibited. Cleavage experiments with hydroxylamine indicate a carboxylate ester type 
      ADP-ribose-protein bond for H2A and H2B and arginine-linked ADP-ribose residues for 
      H3 and H4. ADP-ribosylation preferentially occurs on acetylated histone subspecies, 
      as shown for H4. These data are substantiated by the use of n-butyrate, which 
      induces hyperacetylation of core histones; the butyrate-induced shift towards more 
      acetylated H4 subspecies is accompanied by an increase of ADP-ribose incorporation 
      into highly acetylated H4 subspecies.

TI  - Gravity perception and signal transduction in single cells.
PG  - 479-86
AB  - Cellular signal processing in multi-, as well as in unicellular organisms, has to 
      rely on fundamentally similar mechanisms. Free-living single cells often use the 
      gravity vector for their spatial orientation (gravitaxis) and show distinct 
      gravisensitivities. In this investigation the gravisensitive giant ameboid cell 
      Physarum polycephalum (Myxomycetes, acellular slime molds) is used. Its gravitaxis 
      and the modulation of its intrinsic rhythmic contraction activity by gravity was 
      demonstrated in 180 degrees-turn experiments and in simulated, as well as in actual, 
      near-weightlessness studies (fast-rotating clinostat; Spacelab D1, IML-1). The 
      stimulus perception was addressed in an IML-2 experiment, which provided information 
      on the gravireceptor itself by the determination of the cell's 
      acceleration-sensitivity threshold. Ground-based experiments designed to elucidate 
      the subsequent steps in signal transduction leading to a motor response, suggest 
      that an acceleration stimulus induces changes in the level of second messenger, 
      adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP), indicating also that the 
      acceleration-stimulus signal transduction chain of Physarum uses an ubiquitous 
      second messenger pathway.

TI  - Processing of ribosomal precursor RNAs in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 2647-64
AB  - The processing of intermediates of Physarum rRNA has been investigated using two 
      cloned rDNA restriction fragments as sequence specific probes. The size of the 
      largest stable pre-rRNA detected is 11.8 Kb, as determined by denaturing gel 
      electrophoresis. R-loop analysis revealed that this pre-rRNA fraction mainly 
      consists of transcripts which do not contain the two insertion sequences present in 
      the 26 S gene. However, a small number of molecules are found which still contain 
      one or the other, or both, of these introns. These observations suggest that the two 
      introns are transcribed but spliced out in a random order before RNA synthesis has 
      reached the 3-end of the primary transcript. Transcription starts at about 17.7 Kb 
      and stops at 4.4 Kb as measured from the ends of the linear palindromic rDNA 
      molecule. Besides the 11.8 Kb transcript several further ribosomal RNA precursors 
      have been identified, ranging in size from 2.5 to 8.8 Kb. In addition, the genes for 
      5.8 S RNA have been located by R-loop mapping.

TI  - Regulation of mitosis onset and thymidine kinase activity during the cell cycle of 
      Physarum polycephalum plasmodia: effect of hydroxyurea.
PG  - 263-72
AB  - The effects of hydroxyurea have been investigated on three events of the cell cycle, 
      S-phase, mitosis, and the cyclic synthesis of thymidine kinase, in the synchronous 
      plasmodium of the myxomycete Physarum. DNA synthesis was slowed down with limited 
      action on other macromolecular syntheses and any increase of thymidine kinase that 
      had already been triggered was indistinguishable from that of the control. When DNA 
      synthesis was inhibited, the onset of the following cyclic increase of thymidine 
      kinase synthesis occurred at the same time as in the control, but mitosis was 
      delayed in a very early prophase stage. The arrest of thymidine kinase synthesis 
      occurred after completion of the delayed mitosis. All these effects were suppressed 
      when the action of hydroxyurea was prevented by the addition, to the medium, of the 
      four deoxyribonucleosides. These observations show that (1). The blockage of S-phase 
      does not prevent the nuclei from entering a very early prophase stage but does 
      prevent them from proceeding through metaphase. (2) The transient blockage of DNA 
      synthesis does not perturb the normal timing of the triggering of thymidine kinase 
      synthesis. (3) The signal which triggers the arrest of thymidine kinase synthesis is 
      postmitotic but does not require extensive DNA synthesis. The effect of hydroxyurea 
      is not limited to an inhibition of S-phase. The blockage of DNA replication also led 
      to the dissociation of the normal coordination between two other events of the cell 
      cycle, mitosis and thymidine kinase synthesis. This observation could have strong 
      implications in cell synchronization with chemical agents.

TI  - Primary structure of an alpha-tubulin gene of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 427-38
AB  - An alpha-tubulin gene of Physarum was isolated as a phage-lambda NM1149 recombinant 
      (designated phage-lambda N alpha Tu). Phage-lambda N alpha Tu contained a 4700 
      base-pair HindIII nuclear DNA fragment of an allele of the altB locus of Physarum 
      (one of four unlinked alpha-tubulin gene loci). Subfragments of the 4700 base-pair 
      insert of phage-lambda N alpha Tu were cloned into phage M13 and the nucleotide 
      sequence was determined by the dideoxy chain termination method. The start point of 
      transcription was identified by primer extension and a putative polyadenylation site 
      was located by S1 nuclease analysis. The 4650 base-pair HindIII insert into 
      phage-lambda N alpha Tu spans the complete gene; sequences upstream from the 5' end 
      contain the RNA transcription promoter elements (the TATA and CCAAT boxes). The 
      nucleotide sequence encoding alpha-tubulin contains seven intervening sequences, 
      ranging from 63 to 222 nucleotides in size. The exons have a sequence that is 
      identical with a Physarum alpha-tubulin cDNA clone, except for three base changes, 
      one leading to a Val codon in place of a Met codon, another leading to a Glu codon 
      in place of an Asp codon, and the third change is silent. The genomic clone provides 
      the nucleotide sequence coding for the last 26 amino acid residues missing from the 
      cDNA clone. The new sequence data indicate that the alpha-tubulin gene has a 
      C-terminal methionine codon and not a tyrosine codon, which has been found in all 
      alpha-tubulin genes sequenced to date.

TI  - Studies on the biosynthesis of cytochrome c.
PG  - 89-96
AB  - A soluble cytochrome was isolated and purified from the slime mould Physarum 
      polycephalum and identified as cytochrome c by room-temperature and low-temperature 
      (77 degrees K) difference spectroscopy. A close similarity between P. polycephalum 
      and mammalian cytochromes c was suggested by a comparison of the initial rates of 
      oxidation of both proteins by mammalian mitochondria. This similarity was further 
      emphasized by redox titrations and gel-electrophoretic studies which indicated that 
      P. polycephalum cytochrome c has an oxidation-reduction midpoint potential of +257mV 
      at pH7.0 and a molecular weight of 12500+/-1500 (mean+/-maximum deviation for a set 
      of six measurements). P. polycephalum exhibits an absolute requirement for 
      protohaemin for growth. The (59)Fe-labelled haemin was prepared by chemical 
      synthesis from protoporphyrin. The purified product had a specific radioactivity of 
      0.8+/-0.02muCi/mol. Growth of P. polycephalum in the presence of [(59)Fe]haemin 
      resulted in the incorporation of (59)Fe into the plasmodial cytochrome c. The 
      specific radioactivity of the cytochrome c haem was 0.36+/-0.02muCi/mol. The high 
      specific radioactivity of the cytochrome haem indicates that synthesis of the 
      holoenzyme must proceed by direct attachment of haem to the apoprotein rather than 
      by the intermediate formation of a protoporphyrinogen-apoprotein complex. The 
      observed decrease in the specific radioactivity of the haem group is attributed to 
      exchange of the (59)Fe with unlabelled iron in the plasmodia either before or during 
      attachment of the haem group to the apoprotein.

TI  - Structure-function analysis of mononucleotides and short oligonucleotides in the 
      priming of enzymatic DNA synthesis.
PG  - 1200-7
AB  - The reversed-phase chromatography technique was employed in the measurement of DNA 
      synthesis at the primers d(pT)n, r(pU)n, d(pA)n, and r(pA)n (n = 1-16) in the 
      presence of template poly(dA) or poly(dT). DNA synthesis was catalyzed by 
      Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment, Physarum polycephalum DNA 
      polymerase beta-like, P. polycephalum DNA polymerase alpha, and human placenta DNA 
      polymerase alpha. Values of Km and Vmax were measured as functions of the primer 
      chain lengths. It was found that all mononucleotides and small oligonucleotides 
      served as primers of DNA synthesis. Values of the logarithm of both Km and Vmax 
      increased linearly until primers had attained a chain length of 9-12 nucleotides, 
      where a break was observed. The incremental as well as the absolute values of Km 
      were interpreted in terms of free binding energies. These together with other data 
      indicate that the 3'-ultimate nucleotide of the primer contributes a decisive amount 
      of free energy of binding to DNA polymerase both from the nucleoside and from the 
      phosphate moiety. The incremental increase is due to a complementary interaction 
      between bases of primer and template buried in the binding cleft of the polymerase. 
      It is also the ultimate nucleotide that determines whether the ribonucleotide or the 
      deoxyribonucleotide is an efficient primer. It is of interest that the major results 
      seem preserved for all four DNA polymerases. An energetic model for the binding of 
      the template-primer was proposed and compared with available crystallographic data.

TI  - Primers are designed for amplification and direct sequencing of ITS region of rDNA 
      from Myxomycetes.
PG  - 474-9
AB  - Four new primers were designed, based on comparison of Physarum polycephalum 
      sequences retrieved from Genbank (primers PHYS-5 and PHYS-4) and our own sequences 
      (primers PHYS-3 and PHYS-2), to amplify the ITS regions of rDNA, including the 5.8S 
      gene segment from Lamproderma species. Sequencing analysis shows that Lamproderma 
      contains ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 regions of approximately 900 bp, which is similar in size to 
      most eukaryotes. However, the corresponding region in another common myxomycete, 
      Fuligo septica, is more than 2000 bp due to the presence of large direct-repeat 
      motifs in ITS1. Myxomycete rDNA ITS regions are interesting both as phylogenetic 
      markers in taxonomic studies and as model sequences for molecular evolution.

TI  - 5-Methyldeoxycytidine in the Physarum minichromosome containing the ribosomal RNA 
      genes.
PG  - 1501-15
AB  - 5-Methyldeoxycytidine (5MC) was analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography 
      (HPLC) and by restriction enzyme digestion in rDNA isolated from Physarum 
      polycephalum. rDNA from Physarum M3C strain microplasmodia has a significant 5MC 
      content (about half that of the whole genomic DNA). This rDNA contains many C5MCGG 
      sites because it is clearly digested further by Msp I than by Hpa II. However, most 
      5MC is in other sites. In particular, alternating CG sequences appear to be highly 
      methylated. HPLC of deoxyribonucleosides shows tha most of the transcribed regions 
      contain little or no 5MC. Restriction digestion indicates that there is little or no 
      5MC in any of the transcribed regions including the transcription origin and 
      adjacent sequences. Over 90% of the total 5MC is in or near the central 
      nontranscribed spacer and most methylated restriction sites are in inverted repeats 
      of this spacer. rDNA is very heterogeneous with respect to 5MC. The 5MC pattern 
      doesn't appear to change with inactivation of the rRNA genes during reversible 
      differentiation from microplasmodia (growing) to microsclerotia (dormant), showing 
      that inactivation is due to changes in other chromatin variables. The 5MC pattern is 
      different between Physarum strains. The possible involvement of this 5MC in rDNA 
      chromatin structure and in cruciform and Z-DNA formation is discussed.

TI  - Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate specifically stimulates PP60(c-src) catalyzed 
      phosphorylation of gelsolin and related actin-binding proteins.
PG  - 191-6
AB  - Gelsolin is a widely distributed Ca2+-dependent regulator of the cortical actin 
      network. We demonstrate that gelsolin is phosphorylated by pp60(c-src) and that this 
      phosphorylation is dramatically enhanced by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 
      (PIP2), known to specifically interact with gelsolin. Other phospholipids display 
      only a marginal effect. pp56(lck), a tyrosine kinase of the same family, does not 
      phosphorylate gelsolin. Other mammalian actin-binding proteins such as profilin and 
      CapG but also fragmin from Physarum polycephalum are similar targets for 
      PIP2-stimulated pp60(c-src) phosphorylation.

TI  - Self-organized mechano-chemical dynamics in amoeboid locomotion of Physarum 
      fragments.
LID - 204004 [pii]
LID - 10.1088/1361-6463/aa68be [doi]
AB  - The aim of this work is to quantify the spatio-temporal dynamics of flow-driven 
      amoeboid locomotion in small (~100 µm) fragments of the true slime mold Physarum 
      polycephalum. In this model organism, cellular contraction drives intracellular 
      flows, and these flows transport the chemical signals that regulate contraction in 
      the first place. As a consequence of these non-linear interactions, a diversity of 
      migratory behaviors can be observed in migrating Physarum fragments. To study these 
      dynamics, we measure the spatio-temporal distributions of the velocities of the 
      endoplasm and ectoplasm of each migrating fragment, the traction stresses it 
      generates on the substratum, and the concentration of free intracellular calcium. 
      Using these unprecedented experimental data, we classify migrating Physarum 
      fragments according to their dynamics, finding that they often exhibit spontaneously 
      coordinated waves of flow, contractility and chemical signaling. We show that 
      Physarum fragments exhibiting symmetric spatio-temporal patterns of endoplasmic flow 
      migrate significantly slower than fragments with asymmetric patterns. In addition, 
      our joint measurements of ectoplasm velocity and traction stress at the substratum 
      suggest that forward motion of the ectoplasm is enabled by a succession of 
      stick-slip transitions, which we conjecture are also organized in the form of waves. 
      Combining our experiments with a simplified convection-diffusion model, we show that 
      the convective transport of calcium ions may be key for establishing and maintaining 
      the spatiotemporal patterns of calcium concentration that regulate the generation of 
      contractile forces.

TI  - Consequences of impeding in mitochondrial function in Physarum polycephalum. I. 
      Reversible effects of anoxia, KCN, and influences of the Ca2+ ionophore A-23187.
PG  - 175-86
AB  - 5 mM KCN as well as anoxia have corresponding effects on Physarum plasmodia: Both 
      induce a disintegration of the plasmalemma invaginations, an increase in cytoplasmic 
      vacuoles, formation of a thick cortical actomyosin layer and an increase of 
      cytoplasmic actomyosin fibrils. Both KCN treatment and anoxia cause a temporary 
      increase in the level of the force oscillations and a reversible prolongation of the 
      periods of the contraction-relaxation cycle of cytoplasmic actomyosin. The normal 
      pattern of oscillation can be restored by the addition of 10 mM alpha-ketoglutarate 
      +5 mM AMP to the solution containing 5 mM KCN. A combination of the Ca2+ ionophore 
      A-23187 and KCN induces a strong contracture, whereas a combination of KCN, 
      ionophore, alpha-ketoglutarate and AMP prevents this effect. The state of 
      contracture is characterised by a pronounced increase in the Young's modulus and an 
      increased fibrillogenesis of cytoplasmic actomyosin. The isometrically contracted 
      state during the high force output represents a strict parallel arrangement of 
      F-actin. The capability of alpha-ketoglutarate in combination with AMP to restore 
      the normal pattern of oscillation as well as to inhibit contractures is interpreted 
      as a stimulation of the alternate pathway of respiration. It is suggested that this 
      stimulation leads to a restoration of cellular Ca2+-homeostasis originally disturbed 
      by the impediment of cell respiration.

TI  - An actin-modulating protein from Physarum polycephalum. II. Ca++-dependence and 
      other properties.
PG  - 234-40
AB  - Actin modulating (AM-) protein from Physarum binds as monomer and as a stable 
      heterodimer with one actin molecule to actin and induces the formation of oligomeric 
      actin complexes and short-chained filaments with no definite stoichiometry. While 
      inhibiting the extent of actin polymerization by reducing the size of the aggregates 
      formed, AM-protein increases the velocity of polymerization. The AM-protein monomer 
      depolymerizes F-actin very rapidly by breaking the filaments into small pieces and 
      oligomeric complexes. When a heterodimer of actin an AM-protein is reconstituted the 
      polymerization inhibitor activity is identical to that of the monomer, but 
      depolymerization of actin is almost completely abolished. The action of the 
      monomeric AM-protein on actin is highly Ca++-dependent as it requires micromolar 
      amounts of Ca++ for full activation. The inhibitory activity of both the natural and 
      the reconstituted heterodimer has only little Ca++-sensitivity: A prolonged exposure 
      to Ca++-chelating agents is necessary to obtain a partial inactivation of the 
      heterodimers. The depolymerizing effect on actin of the AM-protein monomer is 
      inhibited by tropomyosin and also by heavy meromyosin. Addition of phalloidin to the 
      actin reduces only the velocity of depolymerization by AM-protein. In the presence 
      of AM-protein the actomyosin ATPase or Acto-HMM ATPase is strongly inhibited. The 
      supposed function of the AM-protein in Physarum is that of a powerful regulator of 
      the polymer state of actin. Such a regulation system is necessary for the dynamic 
      actin transformation processes during ectoplasm-endoplasm transitions and the 
      assembly-disassembly of contractile and cytoskeletal structures. The 
      Ca++-sensitivity of the AM-protein indicates that these processes are controlled by 
      calcium.

TI  - Use of monoclonal antibodies to analyse the expression of a multi-tubulin family.
PG  - 211-8
AB  - We have used a panel of monoclonal antibodies in a study of the expression of 
      multiple tubulins in Physarum polycephalum. Three anti-beta-tubulin monoclonal 
      antibodies, DM1B, DM3B3 and KMX-1 all reacted with the beta 1-tubulin isotypes 
      expressed in both myxamoebae and plasmodia. However, these antibodies showed a 
      spectrum of reduced reactivity with the plasmodial beta 2-tubulin isotype - the 
      competence of recognition of this isotype was graded DM1B greater than KMX-1 greater 
      than DM3B3. The anti-alpha-tubulin monoclonal antibody, YOL 1/34 defined the full 
      complement of Physarum alpha-tubulin isotypes, whilst the anti-alpha-tubulin 
      monoclonal antibody, KMP-1 showed a remarkably high degree of isotype specificity. 
      KMP-1 recognises all of the myxamoebal alpha 1-tubulin isotypes but only recognises 
      3 out of the 4 alpha 1-tubulin isotypes expressed in the plasmodium (which normally 
      focus in the same 2D gel spot). KMP-1 does not recognise the plasmodial specific 
      alpha 2-tubulin isotype. This monoclonal antibody reveals a new level of complexity 
      amongst the tubulin isotypes expressed in Physarum and suggests that monoclonal 
      antibodies are valuable probes for individual members of multi-tubulin families.

TI  - Cell-specific expression of a profilin gene family.
PG  - 323-34
AB  - Profilin is a ubiquitous eukaryotic protein that inhibits actin polymerization. We 
      cloned and sequenced the two profilin genes from the acellular slime mold Physarum 
      polycephalum. The genes, proA and proP, each contain two introns. Primer extension 
      experiments showed two possible transcription start sites in the profilin A gene and 
      one start site in the profilin P gene. The profilin A mRNA has two polyadenylation 
      sites, which yield mRNAs of about 600 and 500 nucleotides. The profilin P mRNA has a 
      single polyadenylation site. The protein sequences were deduced from cDNA nucleotide 
      sequencing. The profilin A and profilin P proteins contain 125 amino acids and are 
      66% identical in sequence. They show sequence similarity to Acanthamoeba 
      (approximately 54%), yeast (approximately 46%), mouse (approximately 22%), calf 
      (approximately 21%), and human (approximately 21%) profilins. The presence of the 
      profilin A and profilin P mRNAs was studied throughout the life cycle. Profilin A 
      mRNA was found in amebas, encysted amebas, and mature spores. The profilin P mRNA 
      was present in plasmodia and spherulating plasmodia. Most cell types of P. 
      polycephalum contain either the amebal or the plasmodial profilin mRNA, and no cell 
      contains both mRNAs. This is the first evidence for developmental regulation of 
      profilin isoforms.

PG  - 1-36
LID - 10.1162/artl_a_00351 [doi]
AB  - We present Monte Carlo Physarum Machine (MCPM): a computational model suitable for 
      reconstructing continuous transport networks from sparse 2D and 3D data. MCPM is a 
      probabilistic generalization of Jones's (2010) agent-based model for simulating the 
      growth of Physarum polycephalum (slime mold). We compare MCPM to Jones's work on 
      theoretical grounds, and describe a task-specific variant designed for 
      reconstructing the large-scale distribution of gas and dark matter in the Universe 
      known as the cosmic web. To analyze the new model, we first explore MCPM's 
      self-patterning behavior, showing a wide range of continuous network-like 
      morphologies-called polyphorms-that the model produces from geometrically intuitive 
      parameters. Applying MCPM to both simulated and observational cosmological data 
      sets, we then evaluate its ability to produce consistent 3D density maps of the 
      cosmic web. Finally, we examine other possible tasks where MCPM could be useful, 
      along with several examples of fitting to domain-specific data as proofs of concept.

TI  - Variation of tubulin half-life during the cell cycle in the synchronous plasmodia of 
      Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 48-55
AB  - The half-life of tubulin has been studied during the cell cycle of the myxomycete 
      Physarum, using a specific quantitative immunological method. In asynchronous 
      microplasmodial and amoebal cultures the apparent half-life of tubulin was greater 
      than 15 h. In contrast, in the naturally synchronous plasmodia, in which tubulin 
      exhibits a cyclic synthesis, we have shown for the first time that tubulin half-life 
      was not constant through the cell cycle. There was no tubulin degradation before 
      mitosis, while tubulin half-life was reduced to about 1 h during the postmitotic 
      period. Such a variation of stability through the cell cycle has not been observed 
      in the case of thymidine kinase, another protein showing a cyclic synthesis in 
      Physarum plasmodia. The decrease of tubulin half-life that occurred during the 
      S-phase immediately following mitosis (no G1-phase in Physarum) was independent of 
      the increase of growth temperature between 22 and 32 degrees C, in contrast with the 
      half-life of thymidine kinase which decreased in the same conditions. Tubulin did 
      not completely disappear after mitosis. A 20% residual amount of tubulin persisted 
      from late S-phase to early G2-phase. We have shown that tubulin degradation was not 
      modified by actinomycin D or cycloheximide but was prevented when DNA synthesis was 
      inhibited by fluorodeoxyuridine and hydroxyurea. In contrast, inhibition of S-phase 
      did not modify the half-life of thymidine kinase. These results indicate that: 1) 
      during the cell cycle, the pool of tubulin is regulated not only at the 
      transcriptional and translational levels but also by a cell cycle-dependent 
      degradative process.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Tubulin isotypes: generation of diversity in cells and microtubular organelles.
PG  - 243-55
AB  - Diversity of tubulin isotypes is illustrated by consideration of the beta-tubulin 
      isotypes of higher plants and the eukaryotic microbe, Physarum polycephalum, and by 
      the alpha-tubulin isotypes of the protozoan, Trypanosoma brucei. The carrot plant 
      expresses six, well-defined beta-tubulin isotypes that possess characteristic 
      two-dimensional gel coordinates. These six beta-tubulin isotypes are differentially 
      expressed during development of the flowering plant. In a similar manner, Physarum 
      expresses three separate beta-tubuli isotypes during its life cycle; of the two beta 
      1 isotypes, one is expressed solely in the myxamoeba whilst the other is expressed 
      both in the myxamoeba and in the plasmodium. A further beta-tubulin isotype, beta 2, 
      is expressed only in the plasmodium. In carrot and in Physarum the generation of 
      beta-tubulin diversity appears, in the main, to be generated by the differential 
      expression of a beta-tubulin multi-gene family. However, tubulin isotypes can also 
      be generated by post-translational modifications and T. brucei utilizes two 
      different modifications within one cell. First, the primary translation product, the 
      alpha 1-tubulin isotype, can be acetylated to produce the alpha 3 isotype. Second, 
      both the alpha 1 and alpha 3 isotypes appear to exist in both tyrosinated and 
      detyrosinated forms. The generation of these alpha-tubulin isotypes within the same 
      cell and their presence in particular cellular domains, modulated throughout the 
      cell cycle, reveals a complex relationship between alpha-tubulin isotypes produced 
      by post-translational modifications and the dynamics of microtubule construction.

TI  - Regulation by Ca(2+)-calmodulin of the actin-bundling activity of Physarum 210-kDa 
      protein.
PG  - 321-8
AB  - From the plasmodia of a lower eukaryote, Physarum polycephalum, we have previously 
      purified a 210-kDa protein that showed similar properties to those of smooth muscle 
      caldesmon. Further characterization of the 210-kDa protein revealed that it bundled 
      actin filaments. This bundling activity was inhibited by calmodulin in the presence 
      of Ca2+. Unlike smooth muscle caldesmon, the 210-kDa protein bundled actin filaments 
      whether or not a reducing agent, such as dithiothreitol, was present. The protein 
      was shown to have two (or more) different actin-binding sites which were classified 
      into salt-sensitive and salt-insensitive sites. Electron microscopy revealed that 
      the 210-kDa protein was an elongated molecule (mean length, 97 +/- 25 nm) which was 
      bent in the middle. The Stokes radius and sedimentation coefficient of the 210-kDa 
      protein were 130 A and 2.9 S, respectively. An immunofluorescence study revealed 
      that the 210-kDa protein colocalized with the bundles of actin filaments in 
      thin-spread preparations of Physarum plasmodia, suggesting that the 210-kDa protein 
      was regulating the appearance and disappearance of the actin bundles that are 
      associated with the contraction-relaxation cycle of the plasmodia.

TI  - Physarum plasmodia do contain cytoplasmic microtubules!
PG  - 509-20
AB  - It has been claimed that the plasmodium of the myxomycete Physarum polycephalum 
      constitutes a very unusual syncytium, devoid of cytoplasmic microtubules. In 
      contrast, we have observed a cytoplasmic microtubule network, by both electron 
      microscopy and immunofluorescence in standard synchronous plasmodia, either in 
      semi-thin sections or in smears, and in thin plasmodia, used as a convenient model. 
      Cytoplasmic microtubules could be seen after immunofluorescent staining with three 
      different monospecific monoclonal anti-tubulin antibodies. The immunolabelling was 
      strictly restricted to typical microtubules as shown by electron microscopy. These 
      cytoplasmic microtubules were entirely and reversibly disassembled by cold treatment 
      and by either of two microtubule poisons: methyl benzimidazole carbamate and 
      griseofulvin. The microtubule network, present in all strains that have been 
      studied, contains single microtubules and microtubule bundles composed of two to 
      eight microtubules. Cytoplasmic microtubules form a dense and complex 
      three-dimensional network, distinct from the microfilamentous domains and from the 
      nuclei. The orientation of the microtubule network varies according to the 
      plasmodial domain examined. Generally microtubules show no special orientation 
      except in plasmodial veins where they are oriented parallel to the long axis of the 
      veins. Differences between our observations and those of previous workers who failed 
      to find cytoplasmic microtubules in plasmodia are discussed. We propose that they 
      reflect difficulties of observation mainly due to the fluorescent background. In 
      contrast with the previous view, the discovery of a microtubule cytoplasmic 
      cytoskeleton in Physarum plasmodia raises several questions concerning its 
      relationships with other cellular organelles and its dynamics during different cell 
      cycle events.

AB  - Fumio Oosawa and his colleagues at Nagoya University laid the foundation for 
      mechanistic studies of actin. Using relatively primitive tools they discovered that 
      actin monomers assemble in a two-step mechanism: highly unfavorable formation of 
      small oligomeric nuclei followed by rapid elongation. Oosawa and his student Sadashi 
      Hatano were the first to purify actin from a nonmuscle cell, Physarum polycephalum, 
      initiating studies of the molecular mechanism of cellular movements.

TI  - Blue light inhibits slime mold differentiation at the mRNA level.
PG  - 261-7
AB  - The influence of blue light on protein synthesis in spherulating Physarum 
      polycephalum microplasmodia was studied using two-dimensional protein separation 
      techniques. The starvation-induced plasmodium-spherule transition proceeds in the 
      dark and is accompanied by the synthesis of 20 major differentiation-specific 
      proteins as revealed by in vivo labelling with [35S]methionine. Three of these 
      proteins are identical with cell wall components with respect to their mol. wts. (35 
      K, 34 K and 14 K) and isoelectric points. Spherulation is also accompanied by the 
      appearance of 26 prominent differentiation-specific mRNA species translatable in the 
      rabbit reticulocyte cell-free system. Six of the proteins synthesized in vitro 
      co-migrate on two-dimensional gels with proteins labelled in vivo, two of them being 
      cell wall components. Blue light, which inhibits spherulation completely, inhibits 
      also the synthesis of spherule proteins and of spherule-specific mRNA activity. Only 
      three protein components are induced by blue light, indicating that illumination 
      does not induce a novel differentiated plasmodial state.

TI  - Preferential expression of one beta-tubulin gene during flagellate development in 
      Physarum.
PG  - 229-38
AB  - The microbial eukaryote Physarum polycephalum displays several distinct cell types 
      in its life cycle, including amoebae, flagellates and plasmodia. Despite its 
      relative simplicity, Physarum has a tubulin gene family of complexity comparable to 
      that of Drosophila. We have identified beta-tubulin cDNAs from Physarum that are 
      derived from the betA beta-tubulin locus and encode beta 1A tubulin. We have also 
      identified a partial cDNA for the unlinked betB beta-tubulin gene, which encodes 
      beta 1B tubulin. The polypeptide sequences encoded by betA and betB show 99% 
      identity, but the nucleotide sequences show only 85% identity, consistent with an 
      ancient duplication of these genes. The betB gene is expressed in amoebae, 
      flagellates and plasmodia, whereas betA is expressed only in amoebae and 
      flagellates. During the amoeba-flagellate transition the level of betA transcript 
      increases over 100-fold, while the level of betB transcript changes very little. 
      Thus Physarum has a mechanism for regulating the level of discrete beta-tubulin 
      transcripts differentially during flagellate development. A need for this 
      differential regulation could account for the maintenance of the virtually isocoding 
      betA and betB beta-tubulin genes.

TI  - Microtubule-associated protein-2 stimulates DNA synthesis catalyzed by the nuclear

PG  - 834-41
AB  - Microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2) isolated from porcine brains stimulated DNA 
      synthesis catalyzed by the nuclear matrix isolated from Physarum polycephalum in the 
      presence of activated DNA as exogenous templates. The degree of the stimulation 
      depended on the amount of the nuclear matrix, but not on that of the template. MAP-2 
      also stimulated DNA polymerase alpha activity solubilized from nuclei, but not DNA 
      polymerase beta activity. These results suggest that MAP-2 stimulates DNA synthesis 
      by interacting with the putative DNA replication machinery including DNA polymerase 
      alpha bound to the matrix. Similar stimulation occurred in the nuclear matrix 
      isolated from HeLa and rat ascites hepatoma cells, which strongly suggests that 
      MAP-2 is involved in the control of DNA replication in eukaryotic cells.

TI  - Structure of Physarum actin gene locus ardA: a nonpalindromic sequence causes 
      inviability of phage lambda and recA-independent deletions.
PG  - 133-44
AB  - Previously we reported that approx. 80% of the genome from the plasmodial slime mold 
      Physarum polycephalum, including all the actin genes, can be cloned only in recBC- 
      sbcB- Escherichia coli hosts [Nader et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82 (1985) 
      2698-2702]. We have now sequenced the actin gene locus ardA. The nucleotide sequence 
      of its coding region is flanked by the typical putative regulatory sequences for 
      transcription initiation and polyadenylation. The coding region is interrupted by 
      five introns, all located at novel positions with regard to those of previously 
      analysed actin genes. Within the ardA gene we have located a 360-bp fragment which 
      comprises exon V and parts of its flanking introns. This region suppresses plaque 
      formation of recombinant lambda phages and causes recA-independent deletions in 
      phages and plasmids. In contrast to our previous hypothesis, this sequence is not a 
      DNA palindrome, but consists of five (dA) X (dT)- and (dG) X (dC)-homopolymers. Both 
      termination of replication and partial unwinding of duplex DNA under torsional 
      stress were detected within the unstable 360-bp region in vitro.

TI  - An actin-modulating protein from Physarum polycephalum. I. Isolation and 
      purification.
PG  - 225-33
AB  - High-speed centrifugation supernatants from slime mould plasmodia show considerable 
      activities to inhibit the polymerization of actin as revealed by viscosity 
      measurements. By following increasing inhibitory activities an actin modulating 
      protein (AM-protein) has been isolated and purified which affects the polymer state 
      of actin. AM-protein has a peptide chain weight of 42 000 and is thus 
      indistinguishable from actin by SDS-electrophoresis, but can be clearly 
      distinguished by isoelectric focussing. Peptide maps from partial proteolytic 
      digests of AM-protein and Physarum actin reveal no similarities thereby excluding 
      that AM-protein is a denatured or modified form of actin. The protein is isolated 
      from crude extracts as a heterodimer with actin to which it strongly binds. This 
      heterodimer affects the polymerization of large amounts of actin by inducing 
      oligomeric or low-polymer actin complexes and thus inhibiting the formation of long 
      actin filaments. The AM-protein/actin heterodimer has only a slight effect of 
      F-actin. It partially depolymerized F-actin within several hours. By ion exchange 
      chromatography in 8 M urea the AM-protein is separated from the actin. The purified 
      AM-protein monomer is renatured and inhibits the polymerization of actin like the 
      heterodimer but additionally, depolymerizes actin filaments very rapidly and 
      effectively by breaking them into oligomer or low-polymer complexes. The addition of 
      less than 1% AM-protein causes a decrease of the specific viscosity of an F-actin 
      solution by 50%. The degree of polymerization inhibition and depolymerization of 
      actin is strictly dependent on the amount of AM-protein added; therefore a catalytic 
      type of reaction between both proteins can be excluded.

TI  - Physical and kinetic distinction of two ornithine decarboxylase forms in Physarum.
PG  - 425-34
AB  - Two forms of ornithine decarboxylase (L-ornithine carboxy-lyase, EC 4.1.1.17) can be 
      isolated from crude plasmodial homogenates of Physarum polycephalum. Both forms 
      catalyze the stoichiometric production of putrescine and CO2 from ornithine, yet 
      they are distinguished by (a) a large difference in their affinity for coenzyme 
      (apparent Km values of 0.13 and 33 muM); (b) a differential stability to extended 
      dialysis of crude homogenates at 4 degrees C; and (c) the tendency of the low 
      affinity form to polymerize when suspended in low ionic strength borate and 
      phosphate buffers. These forms appear to be alternate states of a basic catalytic 
      subunit in that (a) they both demonstrate monomer and dimer molecular forms of 80 
      000 and 160 000 daltons, respectively, depending on the buffer content; (b) they 
      coelute from DEAE-Cellulose ion-exchange columns; and (c) they vary in activity in 
      approximately equivalent yet opposite directions in response to factors which alter 
      this organism's growth or metabolism. These data suggest that ornithine 
      decarboxylase activity may be modulated by the control of the transition of this 
      enzyme between the active and the relatively less active form.

TI  - Regulation of mitosis onset and thymidine kinase activity during the cell cycle of 
      Physarum polycephalum plasmodia: effect of fluorodeoxyuridine.
PG  - 346-53
AB  - The effects of fluorodeoxyuridine were investigated during three events of the cell 
      cycle: S-phase, mitosis, and the cyclic synthesis of thymidine kinase in the 
      synchronous plasmodium of the myxomycete Physarum. DNA synthesis was inhibited, and 
      there was limited action on other macromolecular syntheses. When DNA synthesis was 
      slowed down, onset of the following increase of thymidine kinase synthesis occurred 
      at approximately the same time as in the control, but mitosis was blocked in a very 
      early prophase stage and metaphase was never observed. These effects were suppressed 
      when the action of fluorodeoxyuridine was prevented by the addition of thymidine to 
      the medium. In agreement with the action of aphidicolin and hydroxyurea, these 
      observations show that: 1) perturbation of the S-phase does not prevent the nuclei 
      from entering a very early prophase stage, but it does prevent them from proceeding 
      through metaphase; 2) blockage of DNA synthesis does not perturb the normal timing 
      of the triggering of thymidine kinase synthesis; and 3) the signal that triggers the 
      arrest of thymidine kinase synthesis is postmitotic and does not require extensive 
      DNA synthesis. In contrast with hydroxyurea and aphidicolin, in the presence of 
      fluorodeoxyuridine metaphase was not observed. Thus, the triggering of thymidine 
      kinase synthesis is unambiguously dissociated from metaphase and postmitotic events. 
      Because synthesis of thymidine kinase remains under the control of temperature 
      shifts from 22 to 32 degrees C, a simple model of the cell cycle involving two 
      regulatory pathways could account for the triggering of thymidine kinase synthesis, 
      early prophase stage, and metaphase.

TI  - Cytoplasmic processing events in the polyadenylate region of Physarum messenger RNA.
PG  - 63-70
AB  - Cytoplasmic processing events in the poly(A) region of mRNA from Physarum 
      polycephalum are reviewed. Two classes of poly-containing RNA [poly(A)+ RNA] exist 
      in the cytoplasm. One contains very short poly(A) sequences, averaging about 15 
      adenylate residues, while the other contains relatively long poly(A) sequences, 
      averaging about 60 residues. Molecules with short poly(A) sequences are found 
      exclusively in the polysomes while those with long poly(A) sequences are restricted 
      to the free cytoplasmic mRNP. Since proteins are associated with only the long 
      poly(A) sequences the poly(A) . protein complex is also restricted to the free mRNP. 
      The long poly(A) sequences are relatively short-lived. They are degraded by two 
      distinct processes, a shortening process in which 15-20 residues are gradually 
      removed and a turnover process in which long poly(A) tracts are rapidly converted to 
      the short sequences. This process, along with the dissociation of the poly(A) . 
      protein complex, occurs when poly(A)+ RNA molecules located in free mRNP are 
      transferred to the polysomes. Poly(A) . protein complex dissociation appears to 
      precede poly(A) turnover during translational selection. The significance of these 
      processing events in relation to mRNA maturation is discussed.

TI  - Consequences of impeding in mitochondrial function in Physarum polycephalum. II. 
      Influence on "de novo" generation of contractile activities and responses to glucose 
      and blue light.
PG  - 187-96
AB  - The "de novo" generation of longitudinal contractile activity in endoplasmic veins 
      is inhibited by 5 mM KCN, whereas 10 mM alpha-ketoglutarate combined with 5 mM AMP 
      abolishes this inhibiting effect in spite of a continued presence of KCN. An 
      analysis of the Young's modulus and studies on the morphogenesis of endoplasmic 
      veins reveal morphological effects of an impediment of cell respiration: (1) an 
      increased fibrillogenesis and changes in the spatial distribution of cytoplasmic 
      actomyosin fibrils, (2) an impediment of the "de novo" generation of the plasmalemma 
      invaginations, and (3) the appearance of a thick cortical layer of ground-plasm. 
      These effects of KCN do not appear in the presence of alpha-ketoglutarate and AMP, 
      and disappear by their subsequent application. Impediment of cell respiration by 5 
      mM KCN inhibits the tensiometrically registrable responses to glucose and blue 
      light. Both reactions are restored in the presence of KCN by an additional 
      application of 10 mM alpha-ketoglutarate combined with 5 mM AMP. The importance of 
      mitochondrial function with respect to morphogenetic events and to the perception 
      and transduction of external signals as well as to locomotory reactions of Physarum 
      plasmodia is discussed.

      ribosomal RNA in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 1116-20
AB  - The localization of DNA sequences coding for ribosomal RNA was studied by 
      hybridization of purified ribosomal RNA to DNA from chromatin fragments prepared by 
      limited digestion of Physarum nuclei with staphylococcal nuclease. The 32P-labeled 
      19S and 26S RNA hybridized to DNA from nucleosome monomers, dimers, trimers, and 
      higher oligomers, separated by sucrose gradient centrifugation, although the level 
      of hybridization to DNA from nucleosome fractions was less than the level of 
      hybridization to undigested nuclear DNA. The distribution of 19S and 26S rDNA 
      sequences in the nucleosome fractions differed from the distribution of bulk DNA in 
      that the rDNA sequences were recovered primarily in two fractions containing 
      monomer-sized DNA lengths (140-160 base pairs). The percentage of DNA hybridizing to 
      19S plus 26S RNA was greater in peak A, the more slowly sedimenting monomer peak, 
      than in any other chromatin fraction at all stages of digestion. Peak A and monomer 
      particles differed in protein content and distribution. The presence of ribosomal 
      cistrons in an altered nucleosome configuration may be related to changes in 
      functional states of rDNA chromatin.

TI  - Direct repeats at nuclear matrix-associated DNA regions and their putative control 
      function in the replicating eukaryotic genome.
PG  - 422-7
AB  - Short DNA regions, known to contain replication origins, were isolated from 2 M NaCl 
      resistant nuclear structures of Physarum polycephalum after predigestion with DNase. 
      Regions of 100 bp average length were cloned and sequenced. About 25% of the clones 
      contained direct repeats of 12 to 16 bp and variable base sequences, that have been 
      shown to possess the potential of playing a crucial role in the control of DNA 
      replication. In one of the two alternative three-dimensional configurations such 
      repeats expose single-stranded loops that can function as sites for the initiation 
      of new DNA strands. As these regions are converted into full-length duplexes by 
      their own replication, reinitiation at the same site is excluded. Restoration of the 
      initiationable configuration is considered to be coupled to structural 
      rearrangements involved in the transient condensation of chromosomes in mitosis. 
      This mechanisms ensures that any part of the entire eukaryotic genome is reproduced 
      just a single time during one cell cycle.

TI  - Synchronization and signal transmission in protoplasmic strands of Physarum : 
      Effects of externally applied substances and mechanical influences.
PG  - 574-83
LID - 10.1007/BF00387437 [doi]
AB  - The phenomenon of synchronization of contraction rhythms was investigated on 
      isolated protoplasmic strands of Physarum polycephalum. The strands were mounted as 
      (gymnastic) trapezes; the contraction activities of the arms were measured 
      independently under isometric conditions; and the connecting middle part of the arms 
      was treated in different ways to block the signal transmission between the arms. 
      Experiments for testing the influence of different chemicals on signal transmission 
      demonstrated that whenever a substance blocked signal transmission it also disturbed 
      the normal oscillatory contraction activity of a single strand, the endoplasmic 
      streaming, and the normal architecture of the strand. No substance inhibited the 
      transmission of the synchronizing factor specifically. As a depolarizing medium, 70 
      mM KCl solution did not hinder phase synchronization. On the other hand, compression 
      of the middle part with a glass needle immediately led to dissynchronization as soon 
      as the endoplasmic flow could not pass the point of constriction. Gelation of the 
      endoplasm by a vibrating glass needle placed at the surface of the middle part had 
      the same effect. It is concluded that a bioelectric continuance of the plasmalemma 
      is not sufficient for signal transmission. In contrast, an intact endoplasmic flow 
      appears to be obligatory. According to the experimental data presented, an 
      electrical coupling responsible for phase synchronization between the two arms seems 
      to be unlikely. The unknown synchronizing factor is transported via endoplasmic 
      flow, i.e., the endoplasmic stream seems to present the pacemaker of the oscillatory 
      contraction activity.

TI  - Evolution of RNA editing sites in the mitochondrial small subunit rRNA of the 
      Myxomycota.
PG  - 197-220
AB  - Because of their unique and unprecedented character, it is often difficult to 
      imagine how and why the different, diverse types of RNA editing have evolved. 
      Information about the evolution of a particular RNA editing system can be obtained 
      by comparing RNA editing characteristics in contemporary organisms whose 
      phylogenetic relationships are known so that editing patterns in ancestral organisms 
      can be inferred. This information can then be used to build models of the origins, 
      constraints, variability, and mechanisms of RNA editing. As an example of the types 
      of information that can be obtained from these analyses, we describe how we have 
      used cDNA, covariation, and phylogenetic analyses to study the evolution of the 
      variation in RNA editing site location in the core region of the small subunit rRNA 
      gene in the mtDNA of seven myxomycetes, including Physarum polycephalum. We find 
      that the unique type of insertional RNA editing present in mitochondria of P. 
      polycephalum is also present in the mitochondrial small subunit (SSU) rRNA of the 
      other six myxomycetes. As in Physarum, this editing predominantly consists of 
      cytidine insertions, but also includes uridine insertions and certain dinucleotide 
      insertions such that any of the four canonical ribonucleotides can be inserted. 
      Although the characteristics of RNA editing in these organisms are the same as in 
      Physarum, the location of the insertion sites varies among the seven organisms 
      relative to the conserved primary sequence and secondary structure of the rRNA. 
      Nucleotide insertions have been identified at 29 different sites within this core 
      region of the rRNA, but no one organism has more than 10 of these insertion sites, 
      suggesting that editing sites have been created and/or eliminated since the 
      divergence of these organisms. To determine the order in which editing sites have 
      been created or eliminated, the sequences of the mitochondrial SSU rRNA have been 
      aligned and this alignment has been used to produce phylogenetic trees showing the 
      sequence relationship of these organisms. These phylogenetic trees are congruent 
      with phylogenetic trees predicted by alignment of nuclear rDNA sequences. These 
      trees indicate that editing sites change rapidly relative to mtDNA sequence 
      divergence and suggest that some editing sites have been created more than once 
      during the evolution of the Myxomycota.

TI  - Cytoplasmic polyadenylate processing events accompany the transfer of mRNA from the 
      free mRNP particles to the polysomes in Physarum.
PG  - 83-7
AB  - The relationship between the mRNA in the polysomes and the free cytoplasmic 
      messenger ribonucleoprotein of Physarum polycephalum was studied by microinjection 
      techniques. Labeled free cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein, prepared from donor 
      plasmodia, was microinjected into unlabeled host plasmodia, and its fat was followed 
      in the host ribonucleoprotein particles. Approximately one-half of the 
      poly(A)-containing RNA [poly(A)+RNA] that originated from the microinjected 
      particles was incorporated into the host polysomes by normal translational processes 
      within 1 hr. Very short poly(A) sequences (approximately 15 nucleotide residues) 
      were found in these poly(A)+RNA molecules. These short poly(A) sequences were 
      sensitive to digestion with micrococcal nuclease, suggesting that they were not 
      associated with protein. Because the poly(A)+RNA molecules of the microinjected free 
      cytoplasmic mRNP had originally contained poly(A) sequences 50-65 nucleotides long 
      and were associated with protein extensive poly(A) degradation and poly(A).protein 
      complex dissociation must have occurred during their incorporation into the 
      polysomes or during their translation. These results demonstrate a precursor-product 
      relationship between free cytoplasmic mRNP and polysomal mRNA and suggest that the 
      incorporation process in Physarum is accompanied by structural modifications in the 
      poly(A) region of mRNA. They also imply that the polysome is a site for disruption 
      of the poly(A).protein complex and poly(A) degradation.

TI  - Recognition of specific Physarum alpha-tubulin isotypes by a monoclonal antibody. 
      Sequence heterogeneity around the acetylation site at lysine 40.
PG  - 383-9
AB  - The monoclonal antibody 6-11B-1 recognises specifically the acetylated form of 
      alpha-tubulin. The acetylation event occurs on a unique lysine residue, lysine 40. 
      Using 6-11B-1, acetylated alpha-tubulin was detected in myxamoebae but not plasmodia 
      of Physarum polycephalum. Following chemical acetylation plasmodial alpha-tubulin 
      was detected by 6-11B-1. The monoclonal antibody KMP-1 recognises certain Physarum 
      alpha-tubulin isotypes but only in non-acetylated form. Whilst recognising all the 
      non-acetylated fraction of myxamoebal alpha-tubulin only a proportion of plasmodial 
      alpha-tubulin was recognised by KMP-1. Peptides were synthesised corresponding to 
      the acetylation domains (containing lysine 40) of myxamoebal alpha-tubulin and the 
      inferred acetylation domains of two plasmodial-specific alpha-tubulin isotypes. The 
      only difference between the two peptides was at a single residue corresponding to 
      amino acid 44 in the polypeptide. Tyrosine was present in myxamoebal alpha-tubulin 
      and glycine was present in the plasmodial specific peptides; the peptides are 
      referred to as the Tyr44 and Gly44 peptides respectively. Both peptides in 
      acetylated form blocked 6-11B-1 reactivity towards acetylated myxamoebal 
      alpha-tubulin. The Tyr44 but not the Gly44 peptide blocked KMP-1 reactivity towards 
      non-acetylated myxamoebal alpha-tubulin. Tyrosine at position 44 is not found in any 
      other known alpha-tubulin. Thus a unique antigenic determinant exists in certain 
      Physarum alpha-tubulin isotypes, close to the acetylation site at lysine 40. This 
      antigenic determinant forms part of the KMP-1 recognition epitope and explains the 
      unique isotype selectivity of this monoclonal antibody.

TI  - Invariant temporal order of replication of the four actin gene loci during the 
      naturally synchronous mitotic cycles of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 6393-7
AB  - The chronological sequence of replication for the four unlinked actin gene loci of 
      Physarum has been established. Southern hybridization analysis of density-labeled, 
      bromodeoxyuridine-substituted DNA isolated from defined periods of S phase 
      demonstrates that three actin loci (ardB, ardC, ardD) are duplicated early, 
      corresponding to the first 10% of the genome. The fourth locus (ardA) replicates 
      later, between 80 and 100 min into S phase and after 75% of DNA synthesis is 
      completed. Gene-dosage determinations, based on the quantitation of hybridization 
      signals from DNAs isolated from various times during S phase, confirm the results 
      obtained with bromodeoxyuridine-substituted DNA and increase the temporal 
      resolution. The chronological order of replication in the macroplasmodium appears 
      constant through two consecutive cell cycles and after prolonged growth in 
      suspension culture. The precise chronology of DNA synthesis at the gene level 
      extends to the coordinate replication of allele pairs.

TI  - Sequence and hairpin structure of an inverted repeat series at termini of the 
      Physarum extrachromosomal rDNA molecule.
PG  - 1287-99
AB  - The termini of the 61 kb palindromic rDNA molecules of Physarum polycephalum possess 
      a series of multiple inverted repeats in which are located specific single-strand 
      gaps and tightly attached protein. After treating rDNA with S1 nuclease, we have 
      cloned several 5 kb Eco RI terminal restriction fragments. Sequencing of more than 
      800 nucleotides from the end of one such clone reveals the presence of six to ten 
      tandemly repeated units averaging 140 +/- 4 bp in length and flanked by Hae III 
      sites. Each 140 nucleotide repeat unit can form thermodynamically stable hairpin 
      structures based on complex internal palindromic components. When the specific gap 
      sequence CCCTA is present, it is located near the apex of a hairpin component. These 
      secondary structures are formed in growing plasmodia, as seen in electron 
      micrographs of native rDNA molecules, which also reveal apparent recombination forms 
      involving rDNA ends and noncontiguous DNA segments. Recombination initiated at 
      terminal single-strand hairpin loops can result in genetic exchange of ribosomal 
      gene sequences and can lead to completion of 5' nucleotide sequences at ends of 
      newly replicated rDNA molecules.

TI  - A family of inverted repeat sequences and specific single-strand gaps at the termini 
      of the Physarum rDNA palindrome.
PG  - 875-86
AB  - Ribosomal genes of Physarum polycephalum are located on multiple copies of an 
      extrachromosomal, 61 kb rDNA palindrome. Each terminus of the palindrome consists of 
      a nontranscribed spacer, averaging 5.4 kb in length, which includes a region of 
      multiple inverted repeat sequences. Electron microscopy of denatured and reannealed 
      termini reveals foldback segments that are multiples of a unit length of 50 bp, a 
      length confirmed by sizing of restriction fragments from labeled termini. The total 
      length of this inverted repeat region averages 600 bp per terminus, and the region 
      is centered approximately 4 kb from the 3' end of the 26S gene. Restriction 
      fragments containing the termini are heterogeneous, varying in length by +/- 400 bp. 
      This heterogeneity is due to variability in both the number of 100 bp inverted 
      repeats and the length of additional terminal spacer sequences. The inverted repeat 
      region contains selectively located single-strand discontinuities as revealed by 
      brief incubation with deoxynucleoside alpha-32P-triphosphates and E. coli DNA 
      polymerase I (nick translation). Labelling at the discontinuities begins 
      specifically with the sequence CCCTA. Discontinuities are nonligatable and are most 
      likely gaps one nucleotide long. Each terminus contains 3 to 5 such gaps spaced 
      approximately 200 bp apart. As measured by hybridization with selectively labeled 
      foldback DNA, sequences homologous to the inverted repeats are widely distributed 
      throughout chromosomal DNA.

TI  - The motive force of the migrating pseudoplasmodium of Dictyostelium discoideum under 
      dark and light conditions.
PG  - 131-40
AB  - As a contribution to the understanding of the mechanism of the collective motion of 
      the cell mass in the migrating pseudoplasmodium its motive force has been 
      determined. The measurements in the present paper were made by an original method 
      using centrifugal force. The maximum value of the motive force of a migrating 
      pseudoplasmodium in the dark was estimated as 0.6-1.6 dyn. This value is comparable 
      to the motive force of protoplasmic streaming in Physarum polycephalum. In addition, 
      the motive force in phototactic migration, which has not previously been estimated, 
      was measured. Illumination from the front increased the motive force, whereas 
      illumination from the back produced the opposite results. That is to say, 
      illumination could directly influence the motive force. Furthermore, some 
      interesting results were obtained by measuring the changes in the velocity of the 
      pseudoplasmodia placed under four conditions (combinations of illuminated or 
      non-illuminated, and parallel or antiparallel to the direction of the external 
      force). These results suggest the necessity of taking into consideration the direct 
      effect of light upon the motility of the cells in the migrating pseudoplasmodium.

TI  - Evidence for active interactions between microfilaments and microtubules in 
      myxomycete flagellates.
PG  - 1727-35
AB  - We have previously observed the apparent displacement of microfilaments over 
      microtubules in the backbone structure of permeabilized flagellates of Physarum 
      polycephalum upon addition of ATP (Uyeda, T. Q. P., and M. Furuya. 1987. 
      Protoplasma. 140:190-192). We now report that disrupting the microtubular 
      cytoskeleton by treatment with 0.2 mM Ca2+ for 3-30 s inhibits the movement of the 
      microfilaments induced by subsequent treatment with 1 mM Mg-ATP and 10 mM EGTA. 
      Stabilization of microtubules by pretreatment with 50 microM taxol retarded both the 
      disintegrative effect of Ca2+ on the microtubules and the inhibitory effect of Ca2+ 
      on the subsequent, ATP-induced movement of the microfilaments. These results suggest 
      that the movement of the microfilaments depends on the integrity of the microtubular 
      cytoskeleton. EM observation showed that the backbone structure in control 
      permeabilized flagellates consists of two arrays of microtubules closely aligned 
      with bundles of microfilaments of uniform polarity. The microtubular arrays after 
      ATP treatment were no longer associated with microfilaments, yet their alignment was 
      not affected by the ATP treatment. These results imply that the ATP treatment 
      induces reciprocal sliding between the microfilaments and the microtubules, rather 
      than between the microfilaments themselves or between the microtubules themselves. 
      While sliding was best stimulated by ATP, the movement was partially induced by GTP 
      or ATP gamma S, but not by ADP or adenylyl-imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP). AMP-PNP added 
      in excess to ATP, 50 microM vanadate, or 2 mM erythro-9-[3-(2-hydroxynonyl)]adenine 
      (EHNA) inhibited the sliding. Thus, the pharmacological characteristics of this 
      motility were partly similar to, although not the same as, those of the known 
      microtubule-dependent motilities.

TI  - Mitotic delay following inhibition by 5'-fluorodeoxyuridine of S-phase in Physarum 
      is not due to delay in termination of S-phase.
PG  - 143-54
AB  - It has been known for several years that inhibition by 5'-fluorodeoxyuridine (FdUrd) 
      of DNA synthesis in plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum delays subsequent nuclear 
      mitosis. To test whether this delay is due to delay in the termination of S-phase, 
      we blocked DNA synthesis with FdUrd + uridine for 3 h at different stages of 
      S-phase, and in plasmodia with different cycle times. The results show that in 
      short-cycling plasmodia the delay in mitosis can be as long as 9 h, despite little 
      delay in termination of S-phase, and is longest when plasmodia are blocked in early 
      S-phase. In plasmodia with long cycle times, no mitotic delay following 3 h 
      inhibition by FdUrd of S-phase is observed. Our results suggest that mitotic delay 
      after pulses of FdUrd is not due to delay in termination of S-phase, which therefore 
      does not appear to 'gate' entry into a G2 period of fixed length. The fact that 
      delay is longest after FdUrd blocks in early S-phase suggests that normal progress 
      through S-phase, not its termination, is critical for the timing of the subsequent 
      mitosis. This may reflect an obligate coupling between replication and transcription 
      of specific genes needed for progress toward mitosis. The lack of mitotic delay in 
      long-cycling plasmodia shows that S-phase-coupled processes need not act as 'timers' 
      if other processes become rate-limiting.

TI  - Contractile proteins. Major components of nuclear and chromosome non-histone 
      proteins.
PG  - 529-52
AB  - Two of the major non-histone proteins from Physarum polycephalum have been isolated 
      under nondenaturing conditions and identified as actin and myosin. A third protein 
      has been purified from crude nuclear actomyosin and from residual nonhistone 
      fractions and found to bind actomyosin in the presence of Mg2+. In Physarum these 
      proteins are not components of the nuclear membrane. Based on sodium 
      dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, similar proteins are also present 
      in nuclei of HeLa cells and mouse embryo fibroblasts. Isolated metaphase chromosomes 
      from Physarum show a several-fold enrichment in myosin and an altered ratio of actin 
      to the Mg2+-dependent actomyosin binding protein as compared to interphase nuclei. 
      When non-proliferative states are induced in any of these cells, the Mg2+-dependent 
      actomyosin binding protein decreases while actin increases several fold in 
      intranuclear concentration; concomitantly, there is a generalized condensation and 
      inactivation of chromatin. Experiments with added purified radioactive nuclear 
      actomyosin; comparative studies on nuclear protein during stepwise nuclear 
      purification; and studies on isolated metaphase chromosomes indicate that these 
      proteins exist in nuclei in vivo. These observations suggest that contractile 
      proteins may function in the structural interconversions of chromatin and in the 
      regulation of cell proliferation;

TI  - Physarum myosin light chain binds calcium.
PG  - 63-71
AB  - Myosin from the slime mold Physarum polycephalum contains three sizes of 
      polypeptides: a heavy chain and two light chains, LC-1 and LC-2. Using a simple 
      qualitative test for calcium binding by comparing electrophoretic migration of the 
      polypeptides in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) acrylamide gels in the presence and 
      absence of calcium, we have found that Physarum myosin light chain LC-2 migrates 
      with an apparent molecular weight of 16,900 daltons in the presence of the metal ion 
      chelator ethylene glycol bis (B-aminoethyl ether) N,N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA). 
      However, if calcium chloride is added to the sample prior to electrophoresis, the 
      apparent molecular weight decreases to 16,100. Lanthanide and cadmium ions, but not 
      magnesium, can substitute for calcium. Because the ionic radii of Ca2+, La3+, and 
      Cd2+ are almost identical, we conclude that Physarum myosin LC-2 possesses a very 
      size-specific binding site for calcium. Physarum myosin LC-1 and the heavy chain 
      give no evidence for binding calcium by this test. Since cytoplasmic streaming in 
      the plasmodium of Physarum requires calcium, our evidence indicates that the 
      calcium-binding property of Physarum myosin LC-2 may be important in regulating the 
      production of force by actomyosin in the ectoplasm. Unexpectedly, the myosin light 
      chain in Physarum capable of binding calcium, LC-2, is the essential light chain, 
      while LC-1 is a member of the regulatory class of myosin light chains [V. T. 
      Nachmias, personal communication]. Until now, essential myosin light chains have not 
      been shown to have high affinity divalent cation binding sites. This means a new 
      version of the myosin-based model for actomyosin regulation by calcium may be 
      required to explain cytoplasmic movement in Physarum, and perhaps in other motile 
      systems involving cytoplasmic myosins as well.

PG  - 215-22
AB  - The secondary structure of the large-subunit ribosomal RNA (24-26S rRNA) has been 
      studied with emphasis on comparative analysis of the folding patterns of the 
      divergent domains in the available protist sequences, that is Prorocentrum micans 
      (dinoflagellate), Saccharomyces carlsbergensis (yeast), Tetrahymena thermophila 
      (ciliate), Physarum polycephalum and Dictyostelium discoideum (slime moulds), 
      Crithidia fasciculata and Giardia lamblia (parasitic flagellates). The folding for 
      the D3, D7a and D10 divergent domains has been refined and a consensus model for the 
      protist 24-26S rRNA structure is proposed. Two hundred seventy-seven nucleotide-long 
      aligned sequences representing all or part of the D3, H32-33, D8, D9 and D10 
      divergent domains are used for the construction of unrooted phylogenetic trees 
      either calculated from a nucleotide difference matrix, or determined with the PAUP 
      programme based on the parsimony method. Both phylogenies suggest three major 
      branchings, the first leading to the dinoflagellate (which branches off first), 
      ciliate and yeast, the second to the slime moulds, and the last to the parasitic 
      flagellates.

TI  - Homologous gene replacement in Physarum.
PG  - 147-58
AB  - The protist Physarum polycephalum is useful for analysis of several aspects of 
      cellular and developmental biology. To expand the opportunities for experimental 
      analysis of this organism, we have developed a method for gene replacement. We 
      transformed Physarum amoebae with plasmid DNA carrying a mutant allele, ardD delta 
      1, of the ardD actin gene; ardD delta 1 mutates the critical carboxy-terminal region 
      of the gene product. Because ardD is not expressed in the amoeba, replacement of 
      ardD+ with ardD delta 1 should not be lethal for this cell type. Transformants were 
      obtained only when linear plasmid DNA was used. Most transformants carried one copy 
      of ardD delta 1 in addition to ardD+, but in two (5%), ardD+ was replaced by a 
      single copy of ardD delta 1. This is the first example of homologous gene 
      replacement in Physarum. ardD delta 1 was stably maintained in the genome through 
      growth, development and meiosis. We found no effect of ardD delta 1 on viability, 
      growth, or development of any of the various cell types of Physarum. Thus, the 
      carboxy-terminal region of the ardD product appears not to perform a unique 
      essential role in growth or development. Nevertheless, this method for homologous 
      gene replacement can be applied to analyze the function of any cloned gene.

TI  - Altered nucleosomes of active nucleolar chromatin contain accessible histone H3 in 
      its hyperacetylated forms.
PG  - 6943-6
AB  - Chromatin of the organism Physarum polycephalum contains a class of conformationally 
      altered nucleosomes previously localized to the transcribing regions of ribosomal 
      genes in nucleoli. When nuclei are treated with 2-iodo[2-tritium]acetate, the 
      histone H3 sulfhydryl group of the altered nucleosomes is derivatized while that of 
      folded nucleosomes is not, and the labeled histones can then be identified by 
      autoradiography of gels that separate H3 isoforms. The H3 derivatized is 
      predominantly of tri- and tetraacetylated forms. In contrast, total free histone 
      reacted with iodoacetate shows no preferential labeling of isoforms. Selective 
      reaction of acetylated H3 is prevalent in both nucleolar and non-nucleolar 
      chromatin. The results link specific patterns of H3 acetylation to changes in 
      nucleosome conformation that occur during transcription.

TI  - Actins from mammals, bird, fish and slime mold characterized by isoelectric focusing 
      in polyacrylamide gels.
PG  - 105-12
AB  - Actins isolated from a variety of tissues and cultured cells were compared by 
      isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gels in the presence of 9 M urea and 2% 
      Nonidet P40. Actins isolated from muscle tissue with a sarcomeric structure like 
      skeletal muscle and heart muscle invariably display, as previously shown, one single 
      band with a pI of approximately 5.4 (alpha-actin) in isoelectric focusing gels. 
      Actins isolated from mammalian or avian non-muscle tissue and cultured mammalian 
      cells display two polypeptide bands (beta and gamma-actins) focusing at a slightly 
      higher pH than alpha-actin as a closely spaced doublet. A gamma-like actin is the 
      predominant species in chicken gizzard actin. However, this gamma-like form is not 
      isoelectrically identical with gamma-actin from brain. These results are discussed 
      in relation with the currently available amino acid sequence data known for 
      different actins. Actin isolated from the liver of the electric fish Torpedo 
      marmorata appears to consist of a single isoelectric species with an apparent 
      isoelectric point similar to the beta-actin component of mammalian brain. The actin 
      from the slime mold Physarum polycephalum shows only one single major band in 
      isofocusing gels with an isoelectric point lower than that of alpha-actin.

TI  - Interplay of periodic dynamics and noise: Insights from a simple adaptive system.
PG  - 054215
LID - 10.1103/PhysRevE.104.054215 [doi]
AB  - We study the dynamics of a simple adaptive system in the presence of noise and 
      periodic damping. The system is composed by two paths connecting a source and a 
      sink, and the dynamics is governed by equations that usually describe food search of 
      the paradigmatic Physarum polycephalum. In this work we assume that the two paths 
      undergo damping whose relative strength is periodically modulated in time, and we 
      analyze the dynamics in the presence of stochastic forces simulating Gaussian noise. 
      We identify different responses depending on the modulation frequency and on the 
      noise amplitude. At frequencies smaller than the mean dissipation rate, the system 
      tends to switch to the path which minimizes dissipation. Synchronous switching 
      occurs at an optimal noise amplitude which depends on the modulation frequency. This 
      behavior disappears at larger frequencies, where the dynamics can be described by 
      the time-averaged equations. Here we find metastable patterns that exhibit the 
      features of noise-induced resonances.

TI  - RNA editing is absent in a single mitochondrial gene of Didymium iridis.
PG  - 1288-94
LID - 10.3852/10-019 [doi]
AB  - An open reading frame (ORF) was found in the mitochondrial genome of the Pan2-16 
      strain of Didymium iridis that showed high similarity to the NADH dehydrogenase 
      subunit 3 (nad3) gene in other organisms. So far all other typical mitochondrial 
      genes identified in this organism require RNA editing to generate ORFs capable of 
      directing protein synthesis. The D. iridis sequence was compared to the putative 
      nad3 gene in the related myxomycete Physarum polycephalum, which would require 
      editing. Based on this comparison, editing sites could be predicted for the P. 
      polycelphalum gene that would result in the synthesis of a highly conserved ND3 
      protein between the two organisms. To determine the editing status of the nad3 gene 
      in other D. iridis strains, PCR was used to amplify this region from eight other 
      independent isolates of the A1 Central American interbreeding series. In each case a 
      378 base pair ORF was detected by PCR amplification and sequencing. Three patterns 
      of sequence variation were observed; however all base substitutions were in the 
      third codon position and silent with respect to the amino acids encoded. The 
      distribution of the sequence variants was mapped geographically. The requirement for 
      RNA editing in all other typical mitochondrial genes of D. iridis and P. 
      polycephalum and the presence of RNA editing in the nad3 gene of P. polycephalum 
      suggest that the D. iridis nad3 gene might have been edited at one time. We propose 
      that the D. iridis nad3 gene may have lost the requirement for RNA editing by 
      reverse transcription of an edited transcript that subsequently was inserted into 
      the genome.

TI  - Cytoplasmic actomyosin fibrils after preservation with high pressure freezing.
PG  - 479-95
AB  - The fine structure of the actomyosin system of Physarum polycephalum was 
      investigated in vitrified specimens after applying a pressure of greater than 2.1 
      kbar and freezing rates of 500 to 5,000 degrees C/s. The frozen specimens were 
      either freeze-substituted or freeze-fractured and compared with material processed 
      according to conventional methods of freeze-etching preparation. Artifactual 
      alterations, as seen in the form of destroyed areas of the cytoplasm after chemical 
      fixation, were not observed after freeze-substitution. However, small ice crystals 
      formed by recrystallization within most of the cytoplasmic actomyosin fibrils 
      prevented a fine structural analysis. Such a destruction of the fibrillar fine 
      structure was not found after freeze-etching. In replicas of deep-etched objects 10 
      nm-thick filaments were localized, which could be conclusively identified as 
      F-actin. The actin filaments are located randomly in the peripheral cytoplasm 
      forming the cell cortex. By the process of parallel aggregation, the filaments can 
      be differentiated to fibrils. Thick myosin filaments were not observed. However, 
      structures resembling cross bridges between single actin filaments suggest the 
      existence of oligomeric myosin. The present investigation shows that, in addition to 
      biomembranes, other cytoplasmic differentiations such as components of the 
      groundplasm can be successfully demonstrated employing the deep-etching technique 
      when the freezing methods are improved by avoiding freeze-protection pretreatments.

LID - 1322
AB  - The true slime mould, Physarum polycephalum, develops as a vascular network of 
      protoplasm, connecting node-like sources of food in an effort to solve 
      multi-objective transport problems. The organism first establishes a dense and 
      continuous mesh, reinforcing optimal pathways over time through constructive 
      feedbacks of protoplasmic streaming. Resolved vascular morphologies are the result 
      of an evolutionarily-refined mechanism of computation, which can serve as a 
      versatile biological model for network design at the urban scale. Existing digital 
      Physarum models typically use positive reinforcement mechanisms to capture meshing 
      and refinement behaviours simultaneously. While these automations generate accurate 
      descriptions of sensory and constructive feedback, they limit stepwise design 
      control, reducing flexibility and applicability. A model that decouples the two 
      "phases" of Physarum behaviour would enable multistage control over network growth. 
      Here we introduce such a system, first by producing a site-responsive mesh from a 
      population of nutrient-attracted agents, and then by independently calculating from 
      it a flexible, proximity-defined shortest-walk to produce a final network. We 
      develop and map networks within existing urban environments that perform similarly 
      to those biologically grown, establishing a versatile tool for bio-inspired urban 
      network design.

TI  - Identification and characterization of axopodial tubulins from Echinosphaerium 
      nucleofilum.
PG  - 55-61
AB  - Isolated microtubule protein from axopodia of the heliozoan Echinosphaerium 
      nucleofilum, consisting of two major bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 
      (SDS-PAGE), has been compared to axonemal and cytoplasmic tubulins from both animal 
      and non-animal sources. The upper E. nucleofilum protein band migrated faster than 
      the alpha-tubulins of bovine brain and sea anemone sperm tails but with 
      approximately the same electrophoretic mobility as the axonemal alpha-tubulins of 
      Tetrahymena pyriformis and the alga Chlorogonium elongatum and cytoplasmic 
      alpha-tubulin from the slime mold Physarum polycephalum. The lower E. nucleofilum 
      protein band, however, had a higher electrophoretic mobility than all the 
      beta-tubulins which we have so far examined. It was, nevertheless, a true 
      beta-tubulin as shown by its migration on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and 
      the general resemblance of its one- and two-dimensional peptide maps to those of 
      other beta-tubulins. The Staphylococcus aureus protease cleavage pattern of the 
      upper axopodial protein band was similar to those of other non-animal alpha-tubulins 
      but quite different from those of the animal alpha-tubulins. In contrast, the 
      two-dimensional tryptic peptide map of axopodial alpha-tubulin was distinct from all 
      of them. For example, a characteristic constellation of peptides common to the 
      peptide maps of the other alpha-tubulins was absent from that of E. nucleofilum. In 
      contrast to Physarum and metazoan tubulins but similar to Tetrahymena tubulin, the 
      axopodial alpha-tubulin had a more basic isoelectric point than the beta-subunit as 
      shown by two dimensional gel electrophoresis. Some of the unusual characteristics of 
      E. nucleofilum axopodial tubulin may not only reflect phylogenetic variation, but 
      also the different functional requirements of axopodial microtubules.

TI  - Protein factor which induces conversion between Physarum ornithine decarboxylase 
      forms in vitro.
PG  - 257-67
AB  - The rapid activity modulation of ornithine decarboxylase (L-ornithine carboxy-lyase, 
      EC 4.1.1.17) in Physarum polycephalum is closely correlated with a reversible 
      post-translational modification of this enzyme. A factor has now been isolated from 
      homogenates of exponentially-grown microplasmodia which catalyzes the conversion of 
      the active enzyme form, A, into its less active, B state. Partial purification of 
      this A-B converting factor has been achieved using DEAE-Sephacel chromatography and 
      Ultrogel AcA-34 gel filtration. It appears to be a heat labile, acidic protein with 
      a molecular weight of about 35 000 which binds to large macromolecules in crude 
      fractions isolated using low ionic strength buffers. The in vitro converting 
      reaction requires the presence of spermidine or spermine (1 mM) while putrescine is 
      much less effective, and inorganic cations are ineffective at levels up to 5 mM. 
      Enzyme conversion is reduced in elevated ionic strengths and in the presence of 
      polyamine chelators such as ATP, ADP or GTP (1.0 mM). Under current assay conditions 
      the interaction between ornithine decarboxylase and this factor is stoichiometric, 
      yet it is not reversed even by conditions which favor dissociation of 
      protein-protein interactions. This is the first report of the isolation of a protein 
      factor which is involved in the interconversion of ornithine decarboxylase between 
      its alternate enzyme states.

TI  - Secondary structure of mouse 28S rRNA and general model for the folding of the large 
      rRNA in eukaryotes.
PG  - 4259-79
AB  - We present a secondary structure model for the entire sequence of mouse 28S rRNA (1) 
      which is based on an extensive comparative analysis of the available eukaryotic 
      sequences, i.e. yeast (2, 3), Physarum polycephalum (4), Xenopus laevis (5) and rat 
      (6). It has been derived with close reference to the models previously proposed for 
      yeast 26S rRNA (2) and for prokaryotic 23S rRNA (7-9). Examination of the recently 
      published eukaryotic sequences confirms that all pro- and eukaryotic large rRNAs 
      share a largely conserved secondary structure core, as already apparent from the 
      previous analysis of yeast 26S rRNA (2). These new comparative data confirm most 
      features of the yeast model (2). They also provide the basis for a few modifications 
      and for new proposals which extend the boundaries of the common structural core (now 
      representing about 85% of E. coli 23S rRNA length) and bring new insights for 
      tracing the structural evolution, in higher eukaryotes, of the domains which have no 
      prokaryotic equivalent and are inserted at specific locations within the common 
      structural core of the large subunit rRNA.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of a membrane-DNA complex in the mitochondria of 
      Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 460-72
AB  - A membrane-DNA complex was isolated by centrifugation of sheared lysate of isolated 
      mitochondria in 20-60% sucrose step solution. Analyses using Hoechst 33258/CsCl 
      density gradient centrifugation and restriction endonuclease treatment showed that 
      DNA in the membrane-DNA complex was AT-rich compared with total mitochondrial DNA 
      (mt DNA) and contained Eco RI fragments of E-4, 5 and 8, which were localized on the 
      right hand of Physarum mitochondrial genome. Phenethyl alcohol (PEA) and ethidium 
      bromide (EB) could disrupt the membrane-DNA complex to release DNA fragments from 
      their complex in vitro. Addition of 0.5% or more PEA, which released 80-90% of the 
      DNA from the membrane-DNA complex in vitro, inhibited not only mitochondrial nuclear 
      division but also mitochondrial division in vivo. EB treatment at more than 1 mg/ml 
      disrupted the membrane-DNA complex in vitro to release 77% of the total DNA in the 
      complex. Addition of 10 micrograms/ml EB induced unequal mitochondrial nuclear 
      division in the microplasmodia, e.g., a dividing dumbbell-shaped mitochondrion had 
      the mt-nucleus in one side and as a result formed then one nucleated and one 
      enucleated mitochondrion. From the EB-pretreated mitochondria, a lesser amount of 
      the membrane-DNA complex was isolated than from the control. These findings mean 
      than the unequal mt-nuclear division is due to dissociation of DNA and the membrane 
      system in the membrane-DNA complex. They strongly suggested that the DNA region 
      (E-4, 5 and 8), where the mitochondrial nucleus is associated with the mitochondrial 
      membrane system plays an important role in mitochondrial nuclear division.

TI  - Origin of the membrane potential in plasmodial droplets of Physarum polycephalum. 
      Evidence for an electrogenic pump.
PG  - 637-55
AB  - Spherical droplets, derived from Physarum plasmodia by incubation in 10 mM caffeine, 
      seemed to be an excellent system for electrophysiological studies because they were 
      large (less than or equal to 300 micrometer in diameter) and because they tolerated 
      intracellular electrodes filled with 3 M KCl and 10 mM EDTA for a few hours. Intact 
      plasmodia, by contrast, gave valid records for only a few minutes. Under standard 
      conditions ([K+]o = 1 mM, [Na+]o = 5 mM, [Ca++]0 = 0.5 mM, [Mg++]o = 2 mM, and 
      [Cl-]o = 6 mM at pH 7.0), the potential difference across droplet membranes was -80 
      to -120mV, interior negative. The membrane potential was only slightly sensitive to 
      concentration changes for the above-mentioned ions, and was far negative to the 
      equilibrium diffusion potentials calculated from the known internal contents of K, 
      Na, Ca, Mg, and CL (29.4, 1.6, 3.7, 6.5, and 27.8 mmol/kg, respectively). Variations 
      of external pH did have a strong influence on the membrane potential, yielding a 
      slope of 59 mV/pH between pH 6.5 and 5.5. In this pH range, however, the equilibrium 
      potential for H+ (assuming 6.2 less than or equal to pHi less than or equal to 7.0) 
      was greater than 75 mV positive to the observed membrane potential. Membrane 
      potential was directly responsive to metabolic events, being lowered by potassium 
      cyanide, and by cooling from 25 to 12 degrees C. This ensemble of results strongly 
      indicates that the major component of membrane potential in plasmodial droplets of 
      Physarum is generated by an electrogenic ion pump, probably one extruding H+ ions.

TI  - Purification of tropomyosin from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and identification of 
      related proteins in Schizosaccharomyces and Physarum.
PG  - 90-3
AB  - Tropomyosin is a key component of the contractile systems found in muscle and 
      nonmuscle cells of higher eukaryotes. Based on properties common to all 
      tropomyosins, we have purified a protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae that 
      resembles tropomyosins from higher cells. The yeast protein remains soluble after 
      heat treatment at 90 degrees C, has an apparent polypeptide molecular weight of 
      33,000, an isoelectric point of 4.5, a Stokes radius of 3.5 nm, and a sedimentation 
      coefficient of 2.6 S. It binds F-actin in a Mg2+-dependent, KCl-modulated manner, up 
      to a stoichiometry of about 1 polypeptide per 3.0 actin monomers. In all these 
      properties it is very similar to tropomyosins from higher cells. 
      Antigen-affinity-purified antibodies specifically recognize the Mr 33,000 
      polypeptide among total yeast proteins and crossreact with bovine brain tropomyosin. 
      In addition, the antibodies specifically crossreact with heat-stable Mr 33,000 
      polypeptides in extracts of Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Physarum polycephalum. Our 
      detection of tropomyosin in lower eukaryotes suggests that they might have 
      contractile systems very similar to those found in higher organisms.

TI  - Growth of Physarum flavicomum and Physarum rigidum in chemically defined minimal 
      media.
PG  - 531-4
AB  - Physarum flavicomum, P. polycephalum, and P. rigidum grew at pH 4.2 in a medium 
      composed of mineral salts, glucose, biotin, thiamine, hematin, and four amino acids. 
      Important differences in pH tolerance were noted among the species. The minimal 
      medium of P. flavicomum and P. polycephalum contained the amino acids methionine, 
      glycine, and arginine, but valine was also required by P. rigidum. Starting with an 
      inoculum of about 0.3 mg of protein per 25 ml of minimal medium, P. flavicomum and 
      P. polycephalum grew to 23 mg and P. rigidum to 12 mg of protein per 25 ml in 3, 2, 
      and 4 weeks, respectively. P. flavicomum and P. polycephalum grew with valine or 
      leucine replacing arginine in the minimal medium but the growth yields and growth 
      rates were decreased. All three species utilized homocysteine thiolactone in the 
      minimal media in place of methionine. Serine adequately replaced glycine for P. 
      rigidum but was inhibitory in the minimal medium of P. flavicomum or P. polycephalum 
      unless homocysteine thiolactone also replaced methionine. Growth rates of all three

TI  - Control of actin filament length by phosphorylation of fragmin-actin complex.
PG  - 1081-7
AB  - Fragmin is a Ca2(+)-sensitive F-actin-severing protein purified from a slime mold, 
      Physarum polycephalum (Hasegawa, T., S. Takahashi, H. Hayashi, and S. Hatano. 1980. 
      Biochemistry. 19:2677-2683). It binds to G-actin to form a 1:1 fragmin/actin complex 
      in the presence of micromolar free Ca2+. The complex nucleates actin polymerization 
      and caps the barbed end of the short F-actin (Sugino, H., and S. Hatano. 1982. Cell 
      Motil. 2:457-470). Subsequent removal of Ca2+, however, hardly dissociates the 
      complex. This complex nucleates actin polymerization and caps the F-actin regardless 
      of Ca2+ concentration. Here we report that this activity of fragmin-actin complex 
      can be abolished by phosphorylation of actin of the complex. When crude extract from 
      Physarum plasmodium was incubated with 5 mM ATP and 1 mM EGTA, the activities of the 
      complex decreased to a great extent. The inactivation of the complex in the crude 
      extract was not observed in the presence of Ca2+. In addition, the activities of the 
      complex inactivated in the crude extract were restored under conditions suitable for 
      phosphatase reactions. We purified factors that inactivated fragmin-actin complex 
      from the crude extract. These factors phosphorylated actin of the complex, and the 
      activities of the complex decreased with an increased level of phosphorylation of 
      the complex. These factors, termed actin kinase, also inactivated the complex that 
      capped the barbed end of short F-actin, leading to elongation of the short F-actin 
      to long F-actin. Thus the length of F-actin can be controlled by phosphorylation of 
      fragmin-actin complex by actin kinase.

TI  - Identification and characterization of a cathepsin B-like protease in Physarum 
      sclerotium.
PG  - 1308-16
AB  - In response to dry stress the plasmodium of a true slime mold, Physarum 
      polycephalum, undergoes formation of sclerotium, which is a dormant body resistant 
      to desiccation. The sclerotium can germinate within several hours after addition of 
      water, followed by generation of the plasmodium. In the early phase of the 
      germination many enzymes and other proteins of the sclerotium are required for 
      formation of the plasmodium. As dehydration of proteins often leads to destruction 
      of their structure or reduction in their activity, it is important to elucidate 
      whether the dehydrated enzymes are present as the intact in the sclerotium. In this 
      study three peaks of protease activity were detected with anion exchange column 
      chromatography of the extract from the sclerotia. From among them, an acid protease 
      was purified to homogeneity by gel filtration column chromatography, hydroxyapatite 
      column chromatography, acid treatment, and cation-exchange column chromatography. 
      Treatment of the protease fractions with pH 4.0 resulted in approximately 20-fold 
      activation of the activity. The purified protease was a monomer with a molecular 
      mass of 35 kDa. The optimum pH and temperature were 6.3 and 40 degrees C, 
      respectively. Beta-casein, histone H1, and H2B were degraded by the 35 kDa protease, 
      but human hemoglobin and human serum albumin were very poor substrates. In addition, 
      the enzyme was sensitive to the cysteine protease inhibitors chymostatin, E-64, and 
      leupeptin. These results indicate that, in the sclerotium, a premature form of a 
      cathepsin B-like protease remains non-denatured under dehydrated conditions.

TI  - Phosphorylation by actin kinase of the pointed end domain on the actin molecule.
PG  - 9326-30
AB  - Fragmin from plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum binds G-actin and severs F-actin in 
      the presence of Ca2+ over 10(-6) M. The fragmin-actin complex consisting of fragmin 
      and G-actin nucleates actin polymerization and caps the barbed (fast growing) end of 
      F-actin, regardless of the concentrations of Ca2+, and the actin filaments are 
      shortened. Actin kinase purified from plasmodium abolishes the nucleation and 
      capping activities of the complex by phosphorylating actin of the fragmin-actin 
      complex (Furuhashi, K., and Hatano, S. (1990) J. Cell. Biol. 111, 1081-1087). This 
      inactivation of the complex leads to production of long actin filaments. We obtained 
      evidence that Physarum actin is phosphorylated by actin kinase at Thr-201, and 
      probably at Thr-202 and/or Thr-203, with 1 mol of phosphate distributed among them. 
      This finding raises the possibility that the site of phosphorylation, Thr-201 to 
      Thr-203, is positioned on the pointed (slow growing) end domain of the actin 
      molecule, because growth of actin filaments from the fragmin-actin complex occurs 
      only from the pointed end. These observations are consistent with a model of the 
      three-dimensional structure of G-actin. Inactivation of the fragmen-actin complex 
      may follow phosphorylation of the pointed end domain of actin.

TI  - Amino acid sequence of the calcium-binding light chain of myosin from the lower 
      eukaryote, Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 305-13
AB  - We have established a new method for preparing Physarum myosin whose actin-activated 
      ATPase activity is inhibited by micromolar levels of Ca2+. This Ca2+-inhibition is 
      mediated by the Ca2+ binding to the myosin rather than by the Ca2+-dependent 
      modification of the phosphorylated state of the myosin (Kohama, K., and 
      Kendrick-Jones, J. (1986) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 99, 1433-1446). Ca2+-binding light 
      chain (CaLC) has been suggested to be primary importance in this Ca2+ inhibition 
      (Kohama, K., Takano-Ohmuro, H., Tanaka, T., Yamaguchi, T., and Kohama, T. (1986) J. 
      Biol. Chem. 261, 8022-8027). The amino acid sequence of CaLC was determined; it was 
      composed of 147 amino acid residues and the N terminus was acetylated. The molecular 
      weight was calculated to be 16,131. The homology of CaLC in the amino acid sequence 
      with 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) light chain and alkali light chain of 
      skeletal muscle myosin were rather low, i.e., 25% and 30%, respectively. 
      Interestingly, however, the CaLC sequence was 40% homologous with brain calmodulin. 
      This amino acid sequence was confirmed by sequencing the cloned phage DNA 
      accommodating cDNA coding CaLC. Northern and Southern blot analysis indicated that 
      0.8-kilobase pair mRNA was transcribed from a single CaLC gene. This is the first 
      report on the amino acid sequence of myosin light chain of lower eukaryotes and 
      nucleotide sequence of its mRNA.

TI  - Nucleotide sequence of pig plasma gelsolin. Comparison of protein sequence with 
      human gelsolin and other actin-severing proteins shows strong homologies and 
      evidence for large internal repeats.
PG  - 1127-33
AB  - Pig plasma gelsolin (Mr = 81595; 739 residues) contains 704 identical residues out 
      of a maximum 730 when compared to the cytoplasmic form of human gelsolin. The cDNA 
      sequence also codes for a peptide of 33 residues N-terminal to the nine-residue 
      plasma extension sequence previously reported: these 33 residues are highly 
      homologous to the human signal peptide and plasma extension. Comparison of the 
      gelsolin sequences with chicken brush border villin, severin from Dictyostelium 
      discoideum and fragmin from Physarum polycephalum shows a strong evolutionary 
      relationship between all these proteins. There are six large repeating segments in 
      gelsolin and villin, and three similar segments in severin and fragmin. Although 
      these multiple repeats cannot be related to any known function of these 
      actin-severing proteins, this superfamily of proteins appears to have evolved from 
      an ancestral sequence of 120 to 130 amino acid residues.

TI  - I-PpoI, the endonuclease encoded by the group I intron PpLSU3, is expressed from an 
      RNA polymerase I transcript.
PG  - 5809-17
AB  - PpLSU3, a mobile group I intron in the rRNA genes of Physarum polycephalum, also can 
      home into yeast chromosomal ribosomal DNA (rDNA) (D. E. Muscarella and V. M. Vogt, 
      Mol. Cell. Biol. 13:1023-1033, 1993). By integrating PpLSU3 into the rDNA copies of 
      a yeast strain temperature sensitive for RNA polymerase I, we have shown that the 
      I-PpoI homing endonuclease encoded by PpLSU3 is expressed from an RNA polymerase I 
      transcript. We have also developed a method to integrate mutant forms of PpLSU3 as 
      well as the Tetrahymena intron TtLSU1 into rDNA, by expressing I-PpoI in trans. 
      Analysis of I-PpoI expression levels in these mutants, along with subcellular 
      fractionation of intron RNA, strongly suggests that the full-length excised intron 
      RNA, but not RNAs that are further cleaved, serves as or gives rise to the mRNA.

TI  - Regulatory mechanism in smooth muscle: actin-linked regulation.
PG  - 2863-7
AB  - Our view about the Ca regulation of smooth muscle contraction can be summarized as 
      follows: the regulatory system is actin-linked and consists of tropomyosin and 
      leiotonin; the latter is a complex of two proteins, leiotonin A, the regulatory 
      moiety, and leiotonin C, the Ca-binding moiety. Leiotonin resembles troponin in some 
      respects, but is clearly different in that it has no affinity for tropomyosin and is 
      effective at a leiotonin/actin molar ratio of less than 1:50. The methods of 
      preparing leiotonin were critically reviewed and a suggestion was provided for the 
      development of a new procedure. References were also made to our idea that the 
      myosin light chain phosphorylation may not play an essential role in smooth muscle 
      contraction. With reference to a new type of actin-linked factor from Physarum 
      polycephalum through which Ca2+ represses the actin-myosin-ATP interaction, the 
      diversity of the modes of action of Ca2+ was discussed.

TI  - Presence of the epsilon-(gamma-glutamic)lysine crosslink in cellular proteins.
PG  - 263-8
AB  - The epsilon-(gamma-glutamic)lysine bond is a covalent interaction which has been 
      found to crosslink polypeptide chains of a number of extracellular proteins. Among 
      known covalent bonds crosslinking protein chains, it is unique in that it is formed 
      directly by enzymatic catalysis, a property which may also endow Glu-Lys crosslink 
      formation with important intracellular functions. We found glutamic-lysine bonds to 
      be present in the procaryote, Escherichia coli, in primitive eucaryotes such as the 
      slime mold, Physarum polycephalum, and the ciliate, Paramecium aurelia, and in 
      muscle cells of a bird and a mammal. Our data show that, although Glu-Lys bonds 
      occur in low concentrations in cellular proteins, they are nevertheless widely 
      distributed. Evidence is also presented indicating that the low levels of the 
      Glu-Lys bonds we measure in the proteins of various cells types are not artifacts of 
      our analytical procedures.

TI  - Some evidence for replication-transcription coupling in Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 27-39
AB  - Hydroxyurea, at concentrations of 40-60 mM, selectively and effectively blocked 
      incorporation of thymidine into DNA. Inhibition occurred within 5-10 min of 
      application of the agent when DNA synthesis was in progress, while the onset of 
      replication at the beginning of S-phase and DNA synthesis in G2 phase were not 
      affected. Uridine incorporation into TCA-precipitable material, in the presence of 
      hydroxyurea, was significantly (up to 70%) inhibited in early S-phase of the cell 
      cycle. Selective inhibition of RNA synthesis was confirmed for RNA separated into 
      rRNA-rich and poly(A)-rich RNA fractions and analysed by the 2 kinds of DNA-RNA 
      hybridization reactions. Uridine incorporation into poly (A) RNA was also inhibited 
      under conditions where cycloheximide prevented maturation of nascent DNA molecules 
      in early S-phase. We assume that chromatin which is replicating early DNA sequences 
      may be a more competent template for transcription.

TI  - An Argument for an Ecosystemic AI: Articulating Connections across Prehuman and 
      Posthuman Intelligences.
PG  - 559-584
LID - 10.1007/s42413-020-00092-5 [doi]
AB  - As an art collective Cesar & Lois develops projects that examine sociotechnical 
      systems, attempting to challenge anthropocentric technological pathways while 
      linking to intelligences sourced in biological circuitry. As artists we imagine new 
      configurations for what we understand as (social, economic, technological) networks 
      and intelligences. With this ecosystemic approach we consider the possibility of an 
      artificial intelligence (AI) that supports well-being in a broad sense, 
      accommodating relationships across different layers of living worlds and involving 
      local and global communities of all kinds. This thinking is grounded in research by 
      theorists across disciplines, including communications and media theory, 
      microbiology, anthropology, decolonial studies, social ecology, sociology and 
      environmental psychology. At a time when human beings and their ecosystems face 
      grave threats due to climate change and a global pandemic, we are rethinking the 
      basis for our AIs, and for the resulting decision-making on behalf of societies and 
      ecosystems. Creative projects by Cesar & Lois provide alternative conceptual models 
      for thinking across networks, reframing the artists' and potentially viewers' 
      understanding of what motivates and shapes societies. Referencing a series of 
      artworks and the theories that underpin them, this article envisages a 
      sociotechnical framework that takes into account ecosystems and challenges the 
      philosophical orientations that guide society. Degenerative Cultures is an artwork 
      in which the artists overlap microbiological organisms, AI and human systems as a 
      speculative restructuring of networks across human and nonhuman entities. The push 
      for ecosystemic technologies and intelligences is linked to the expansion of 
      community to include planetary constituents, such as nonhuman beings and 
      environments. The artists posit that such ecosystemic networks would be capable of 
      taking into account the planet's human societies as well as nonhuman species and 
      their environments, broadening the concept of community well-being and shifting the 
      technological architecture to meet the complex needs of the planet and its 
      constituent parts. The experimental series, [ECO]nomic Revolution, layers Physarum 
      polycephalum, or slime mold, over the mapped demographics of human cities. The 
      species polycephalum references multi-brains, and implies a decentralized logic, 
      which for the non-neurological microbiological network translates to the sharing of 
      nutrients and regulated growth across a culture. Assuming a perspective based in the 
      arts, this proposition imagines a shift from the dominant conceptions of AI as an 
      individual intelligence and frames it as part of a network that necessarily includes 
      ecosystems. We envision the creation of sociotechnical systems that could be modeled 
      on networked lifeforms that have optimized themselves across millions of years, like 
      the organism Physarum polycephalum, which occurs globally in moist environments, or 
      like those microbial populations within and outside of human bodies, whose 
      percussive biological processing interacts with and alters many layers of lifeforms. 
      We argue that an environmentally responsive intelligence based on relationships 
      across living systems potentially serves a broad community composed of diverse human 
      populations, nonhuman beings and ecosystems.

TI  - Phosphorylation of ornithine decarboxylase by a polyamine-dependent protein kinase.
PG  - 5518-22
AB  - This paper presents evidence that a polyamine-dependent protein kinase (EC 2.7.1.37) 
      purified from nuclei of the slime mold Physarum polycephalum catalyzes 
      phosphorylation of ornithine decarboxylase (OrnDCase; L-ornithine carboxy-lyase, EC 
      4.1.1.17). The protein kinase had properties similar to OrnDCase antizyme. 
      Phosphocellulose chromatography of nuclear preparations from P. polycephalum yielded 
      the polyamine-dependent protein kinase of subunit Mr 26,000 that was resolved from a 
      second fraction in which the protein kinase copurified with a phosphate-acceptor 
      protein of subunit Mr 70,000. At Na+ concentrations less than approximately 150 mM, 
      a complex formed between the protein kinase and the phosphate-acceptor protein. The 
      complex did not demonstrate protein kinase or OrnDCase activity. The complex was 
      dissociated by greater than 150 mM Na+ into its constituent proteins. The 
      dissociated complex catalyzed phosphorylation of the Mr 70,000 component in the 
      presence of spermidine and spermine, and it also demonstrated OrnDCase activity. The 
      purified Mr 70,000 component from the complex and authentic OrnDCase, purified by 
      procedures previously reported, were virtually identical with respect to OrnDCase 
      activity, capacity to be phosphorylated by the polyamine-dependent protein kinase, 
      amino acid composition, and immunological crossreactivity. Phosphorylation of 
      OrnDCase by the polyamine-dependent protein kinase sharply inhibited OrnDCase 
      activity. Thus, this is an example of posttranslational covalent modification of 
      OrnDCase with concurrent alteration of its catalytic function. It is also an unusual 
      example of control of the first enzyme in a biosynthetic pathway by a protein kinase 
      that is, in turn, modulated by the immediate end products of the pathway.

TI  - Close relationship between certain nuclear and mitochondrial introns. Implications 
      for the mechanism of RNA splicing.
PG  - 595-605
AB  - We present the first indication of a direct relationship between a nuclear and a 
      mitochondrial splicing system. The intron in the precursor of the large, nuclearly 
      coded ribosomal RNA of two species of Tetrahymena possesses all the features of a 
      class of fungal mitochondrial introns. Sequences conserved in mitochondrial introns 
      of different fungal species are also found in the same order in these Tetrahymena 
      nuclear introns, and the intron RNA can be folded to form a secondary structure 
      similar to that proposed for mitochondrial introns by Davies et al. (1982). This 
      "core" secondary structure brings the ends of the intron together. Furthermore, the 
      first intron in the precursor of the large, nuclearly coded rRNA of Physarum 
      polycephalum also has the characteristic conserved sequences and core RNA secondary 
      structure. The limited sequence data available suggest that the intron in the large 
      rRNA of chloroplasts in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii also resembles the mitochondrial 
      introns. Tetrahymena large nuclear rRNA introns also have an internal sequence that 
      can act as an adaptor by pairing with upstream and downstream exon sequences 
      adjacent to the splice junctions to precisely align the splice junctions. These 
      nuclear introns therefore fit the model of the role of intron RNA in the splicing 
      process that was proposed by Davies et al. (1982), suggesting that the mechanisms of 
      splicing may be very similar in these apparently diverse systems. It is therefore 
      probable that the RNA secondary structures for which there is good evidence in the 
      case of mitochondrial introns will be found to form the basis of active site 
      structure and precise alignment in splicing and cyclization of the Tetrahymena 
      intron "ribozyme".

      functions for the histone tail domains.
PG  - 14-21
LID - 10.1139/o11-044 [doi]
AB  - The maintenance of the genome during replication requires the assembly of 
      nucleosomes with newly synthesized histones. Achieving the deposition of newly 
      synthesized histones in chromatin implies their transport from the cytoplasm to the 
      nucleus at the replication sites. Several lines of evidence have revealed critical 
      functions of the histone tail domains in these conserved cellular processes. In this 
      review, we discuss the role of the amino termini of the nucleosome building blocks, 
      H2A/H2B and H3/H4, in different model systems. The experimental data showed that 
      H2A/H2B tails and H3/H4 tails display distinct functions in nuclear import and 
      chromatin assembly. Furthermore, we describe recent studies exploiting the unique 
      properties of the slime mold, Physarum polycephalum , that have advanced 
      understanding of the function of the highly conserved replication-dependent 
      diacetylation of H4.

TI  - Interruptions in single strands of the DNA in slime mold and other organisms.
PG  - 309-17
AB  - The molecular weight of single-stranded DNA from the slime mold Physarum 
      polycephalum has been determined by alkaline gradient centrifugation. The average 
      molecular weight during DNA synthesis ( approximately 1.5 x 10(7) D) is less than 
      that observed in nonsynthetic periods ( approximately 4 x 10(7) D). On the basis of 
      a chromosome number of 50 per nucleus and a DNA content of 1 mumug per nucleus, we 
      are led to conclude that at pH 12 each chromosome dissociates into 300 
      (single-stranded) pieces of DNA. We have also compared the sedimentation profiles of 
      single-stranded DNA from Escherichia coli, PPLO, and T2 bacteriophage. These data 
      support the conjecture that each bacterial chromosome can be dissociated into 10 or 
      12 single-stranded pieces of DNA. Dissociation of DNA into multiple pieces under our 
      experimental conditions is best interpreted in terms of interruptions in the 
      continuity of the DNA either by naturally occurring gaps or at alkali-labile bonds.

AB  - Choosing a better move correctly and quickly is a fundamental skill of living 
      organisms that corresponds to solving a computationally demanding problem. A 
      unicellular plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum searches for a solution to the 
      travelling salesman problem (TSP) by changing its shape to minimize the risk of 
      being exposed to aversive light stimuli. In our previous studies, we reported the 
      results on the eight-city TSP solution. In this study, we show that the time taken 
      by plasmodium to find a reasonably high-quality TSP solution grows linearly as the 
      problem size increases from four to eight. Interestingly, the quality of the 
      solution does not degrade despite the explosive expansion of the search space. 
      Formulating a computational model, we show that the linear-time solution can be 
      achieved if the intrinsic dynamics could allocate intracellular resources to grow 
      the plasmodium terminals with a constant rate, even while responding to the stimuli. 
      These results may lead to the development of novel analogue computers enabling 
      approximate solutions of complex optimization problems in linear time.

TI  - Assay of diadenosine tetraphosphate hydrolytic enzymes by boronate chromatography.
PG  - 296-304
AB  - A new procedure was described for assay of diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap4A) 
      hydrolases based on boronate chromatography. Potential reaction products, AMP, ADP, 
      and ATP, of the hydrolysis of Ap4A were separated from residual substrate by 
      chromatography on a boronate-derivatized cation-exchange resin, Bio-Rex 70. 
      Separation was achieved by changing the concentrations of ethanol and ammonium 
      acetate in the elution buffers. Picomole masses of products were detectable, blank 
      dpm values were less than 0.5% of the total dpm, and auxiliary enzymes were not 
      required. The procedure was specifically described for Ap4A pyrophosphohydrolase 
      from Physarum polycephalum. The assay is generally applicable for dinucleoside 
      polyphosphate hydrolases which hydrolyze other substrates such as Ap3A, Ap5A, Ap6A, 
      and Gp4G. Dinucleotide polyphosphates are readily purified by chromatography on this 
      boronate resin in a volatile buffer. Tes, Tricine, and Tris buffers significantly 
      interfered with the chromatography of ATP.

TI  - Rewriting the information in DNA: RNA editing in kinetoplastids and myxomycetes.
PG  - 620-6
AB  - RNA editing has a major impact on the genes and genomes that it modifies. Editing by 
      insertion, deletion and base conversion exists in nuclear, mitochondrial and viral 
      genomes throughout the eukaryotic lineage. Editing was first discovered in 
      kinetoplastids, and recent work has resulted in the characterization of some 
      components of the editing machinery. Two proteins with ligase activity have been 
      identified in Trypanosoma brucei, and other proteins in the editosome complex are 
      yielding to the probe of research. A second group of protists, myxomycetes, are 
      unique in their use of four different types of editing within a single transcript. 
      Phylogenetic analysis of editing in representative myxomycetes revealed a different 
      history of the four types of editing in this lineage. Development of a soluble in 
      vitro editing system has provided further support for the co-transcriptional nature 
      of editing in Physarum polycephalum, and will certainly provide future opportunities 
      for understanding this mysterious process.

AB  - Plasmodial cells of the slime moldPhysarum polycephalum become competent for 
      sporulation following a prolonged period of starvation in darkness. Then sporulation 
      can be induced by illumination. Microinjections of the stable (Sp)- and 
      (Rp)-diastereoisomers of adenosine cyclic 3',5' monothionophosphate before and 
      during a sensitive period from the start of illumination until 5 h after lead to a 
      significant delay in the sporulation process.Both of the diastereoisomers of cyclic 
      AMP prolong the time for sporangia to form in darkness. However, the 
      (Sp)-diastereoisomer is more effective and causes morphological changes in 
      plasmodia.The experimental data suggest that cyclic AMP is decisively involved in 
      light-induced differentiation in the lower eukaryotoPhysarum polycephalum.

TI  - [Cyclic nucleotides in the regulation system of cell proliferation and 
      differentiation].
PG  - 52-62
AB  - The paper deals with certain aspects in the role of cyclic nucleotides in cell 
      differentiation and proliferation. The content of cyclic nucleotides and activity of 
      protein kinases are determined for the cell cycle stages of a synchronous plasmodium 
      culture of true myxomycete Physarum polycephalum. Studies in the biological role of 
      the brain cAMP-dependent protein kinase show that during phosphorylation of nuclei 
      from the brain and subsequent isolation of chromatin its matrix activity is higher 
      than the control one. When a regulatory subunit is added to the standard 
      RNA-polymerase reaction, the total level of transcription increases for eucaryote 
      RNA-polymerase. The constant of the regulatory subunit binding with chromatin from 
      the brain is 10(10) M-1. Studies in translocation of tritium-labelled cAMP-dependent 
      protein kinase and its subunits to interphase nuclei and in acception of these 
      proteins by metaphase chromosomes in different cell cultures state that 
      sAMP-dependent protein kinase penetrates into the nucleus in the dissociated state. 
      It is established that disturbance of the regulatory subunits translocation into the 
      nucleus and its acception by chromosomes when cell are transformed by SV40 virus is 
      completely restored by adding cAMP. For cells, which suffered the malignant 
      transformation of another type (spontaneous human cancer--KB, HeLa), and essential 
      nuclear translocation and a complete absence of acception by chromosomes for the 
      regulatory subunit are found. An assumption is made that compartmentation of 
      cAMP-dependent protein kinase, in particular of its regulatory subunit, plays an 
      important role in the organism vital activity and disturbances arising in neoplastic 
      transformation are connected with changes in translocation and acception of the 
      regulatory subunit in the nucleus.

TI  - Evolution of a protein superfamily: relationships between vertebrate lens 
      crystallins and microorganism dormancy proteins.
PG  - 140-5
AB  - A search of sequence databases shows that spherulin 3a, an encystment-specific 
      protein of Physarum polycephalum, is probably structurally related to the beta- and 
      gamma-crystallins, vertebrate ocular lens proteins, and to Protein S, a 
      sporulation-specific protein of Myxococcus xanthus. The beta- and gamma-crystallins 
      have two similar domains thought to have arisen by two successive gene duplication 
      and fusion events. Molecular modeling confirms that spherulin 3a has all the 
      characteristics required to adopt the tertiary structure of a single 
      gamma-crystallin domain. The structure of spherulin 3a thus illustrates an earlier 
      stage in the evolution of this protein superfamily. The relationship of beta- and 
      gamma-crystallins to spherulin 3a and Protein S suggests that the lens proteins were 
      derived from an ancestor with a role in stress-response, perhaps a response to 
      osmotic stress.

TI  - An intron in the 23S ribosomal gene of the archaebacterium Desulfurococcus mobilis.
PG  - 675-7
AB  - The archaebacteria have been defined, at a molecular level, as constituting a third 
      primary kingdom consisting of the methanogens, the extreme halophiles, and the 
      sulphur-dependent extreme thermophiles. In reaching this conclusion, Woese and 
      colleagues used the 16S ribosomal RNA as an approximate chronometer for evolutionary 
      time and demonstrated that, at a nucleotide sequence level, the archaebacteria are 
      as different from the eubacteria and eukaryotes as the latter kingdoms are from one 
      another. Current research on archaebacteria is yielding valuable insights into the 
      evolutionary relationships between archaebacteria, eubacteria and eukaryotes, and 
      into the early forms of cellular life. Here, we extend this knowledge by providing 
      the first evidence for the occurrence of an intron within any prokaryotic ribosomal 
      RNA. The intron was found within the 23S rRNA gene of the sulphur-dependent and 
      anaerobic Thermoproteale Desulfurococcus mobilis, which was isolated from hot acidic 
      springs in Iceland at temperatures up to 97°C. The intron contains 622 base pairs 
      (bp); it is very A+T-rich (65%) compared with the 23S rRNA gene (34%), and it 
      exhibits a large open reading frame. The splicing site occurs in domain IV of the 
      23S RNA at a position close to that of an intron of the lower eukaryote Physarum 
      polycephalum; the intron does not readily fall into one of the three classes of 
      eukaryotic nuclear introns because it has features in common with those of classes I 
      (rRNA) and III (transfer RNA).

TI  - Optimizing biologically inspired transport networks by control.
PG  - 032309
LID - 10.1103/PhysRevE.100.032309 [doi]
AB  - Transportation networks with intrinsic flow dynamics governed by the Kirchhoff's 
      current law are ubiquitous in natural and engineering systems. There has been recent 
      work on designing optimal transportation networks based on biological principles 
      with the goal to minimize the total dissipation associated with the flow. Despite 
      being biologically inspired, e.g., adaptive network design based on slime mold 
      Physarum polycephalum, such methods generally lead to suboptimal networks due to the 
      difficulty in finding a global or nearly global optimum of the nonconvex 
      optimization function. Here we articulate a design paradigm that combines 
      engineering control and biological principles to realize optimal transportation 
      networks. In particular, we show how small control signals applied only to a 
      fraction of edges in an adaptive network can lead to solutions that are far more 
      optimal than those based solely on biological principles. We also demonstrate that 
      control signals, if not properly designed, can lead to networks that are less 
      optimal. Incorporating control principle into biology-based optimal network design 
      has broad applications not only in biomedical science and engineering but also in 
      other disciplines such as civil engineering for designing resilient infrastructure 
      systems.

TI  - Sulfhydryl groups of native myosin and of the myosin heavy chains from Physarum 
      polycephalum compared to vertebrate skeletal, smooth, and non-muscle myosins.
PG  - 198-205
AB  - Although a previously reported analysis of Physarum myosin detected no cysteine 
      residues in the molecule, the myosin ATPase activity was inhibited by 
      p-chloromercuribenzoate. We have re-examined this apparently contradictory finding. 
      We found highly purified plasmodial myosin to be very sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide 
      inhibition of the K+, Ca2+ -activated ATPase. An estimate of the number of reactive 
      sulfhydryls of the native myosin using Ellman's reagent showed only 1.5 mol 11 
      min-reactive sulfhydryl/mol as compared to 4.5 for chicken breast myosin in 5 min. 
      3H- and 14C-labelled N-ethylmaleimide was used to estimate the total sulfhydryls of 
      the SDS-denatured heavy chains. Plasmodial myosin heavy chains bound 10-13% of the 
      N-ethylmaleimide bound by chicken breast myosin heavy chains. Smooth muscle myosin 
      heavy chains as well as heavy chains of embryonic chicken presumptive myoblasts had 
      65-70% of the reactive groups of chicken myotube myosin heavy chains. Amino acid 
      analyses of purified Physarum myosin showed that some preparations contained cysteic 
      acid residues even before performic oxidation. After the performic oxidation a mean 
      value of 3 mol cysteic acid per 10(5) g Physarum myosin was found, or less than half 
      that reported for striated muscle myosin. Our results show that in the 
      sulfhydryl-poor plasmodial myosin each heavy chain contains at least two 
      sulfhydryls, and probably more, but that there is variable oxidation of the total 
      sulfhydryls. It has been reported that plasmodial myosin lacks rapidly reacting 
      sulfhydryls groups when tested with an ATP analogue which reacts with light chains 
      of vertebrate muscle myosins. Therefore, the 1-2 sulfhydryls of plasmodial myosin 
      which react rapidly with Ellman's reagent appear to be on the heavy chain. Our 
      results also suggest that during development of myotubes changes occur in the myosin 
      heavy chains.

TI  - Actin-fragmin interactions as revealed by chemical cross-linking.
PG  - 435-40
AB  - A one to one complex of actin and fragmin (a capping protein from Physarum 
      polycephalum plasmodia) was cross-linked with 1-ethyl-3-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl] 
      carbodiimide. The cross-linking reaction generated two cross-linked products with 
      slightly different molecular weights (88 000 and 90 000) as major species. They were 
      cross-linked products of one actin and one fragmin. The cross-linking site of 
      fragmin in the actin sequence was determined by peptide mappings [Sutoh, K. (1982) 
      Biochemistry 21, 3654-3661] after partial chemical cleavages of cross-linked 
      products with hydroxylamine. The results indicated that the N-terminal segment of 
      actin spanning residues 1-12 participated in cross-linking with fragmin. The 
      cross-linker used in this study covalently bridges lysine side chains and side 
      chains of acidic residues when they are in direct contact. Therefore, it seems that 
      acidic residues in the N-terminal segment of actin (Asp-1, Glu-2, Asp-3, Glu-4, and 
      Asp-11), at least some of them, are in the binding site of fragmin. It has already 
      been shown that the same acidic segment of actin is in the binding site of myosin or 
      depactin (an actin-depolymerizing protein isolated from starfish oocytes). We 
      suggest that the unusual amino acid sequence of the N-terminal segment of actin 
      makes its N-terminal region a favorable anchoring site for various types of 
      actin-binding proteins.

TI  - Posttranslational control of ornithine decarboxylase by polyamine-dependent protein 
      kinase.
PG  - 3078-83
AB  - In nuclei and nucleoli of the slime mold Physarum polycephalum, ornithine 
      decarboxylase (OrnDCase) (Mr 70,000) is phosphorylated by a protein kinase reaction 
      that is dependent on spermidine and spermine. Putrescine antagonizes the 
      phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of OrnDCase inhibits its capacity to catalyze 
      decarboxylation of ornithine. The protein kinase that catalyzes this phosphorylation 
      has many properties similar to those of nuclear protein kinase II, or type G, which 
      has been studied by other groups. The interaction of this protein kinase with 
      OrnDCase resembles the behavior of the OrnDCase antizyme described by other 
      investigators. Phosphorylated OrnDCase binds to purified, palindromic rDNA isolated 
      from nucleoli. It also stimulates transcription of the ribosomal genes by RNA 
      polymerase I in a chromatin form of rDNA. It does not stimulate transcription in a 
      purified, homologous transcription system comprised of RNA polymerase I, rDNA, and 
      phospho-OrnDCase. Thus, phospho-OrnDCase may have a function in promoting rRNA gene 
      transcription but the detailed mechanism is yet unclear. The polyamine-dependent 
      protein kinase and its natural substrate of 70,000 daltons have been demonstrated in 
      other eukaryotic cells, including bovine spermatozoa and rat liver nuclei, and in 
      Ehrlich ascites tumor cells, where the protein kinase is induced by interferon. This 
      phosphorylation system appears to be widely distributed and conserved among 
      eukaryotic species.

TI  - Ornithine decarboxylase from Neurospora crassa. Purification, characterization, and 
      regulation by inactivation.
PG  - 7889-93
AB  - Ornithine decarboxylase, a highly regulated enzyme of the polyamine pathway, was 
      purified 670-fold from mycelia of Neurospora crassa that were highly augmented for 
      enzyme activity. The enzyme is significantly different from those reported from 
      three other lower eucaryotic organisms: Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Physarum 
      polycephalum, and Tetrahymena pyriformis. Instead, the enzyme closely resembles the 
      enzymes from mammals. The Mr = 110,000 enzyme is a dimer of 53,000 Da subunits, with 
      a specific activity of 2,610 mumol per h per mg of protein. Antisera were raised to 
      the purified enzyme and were rendered highly specific by cross-absorption with 
      extracts of a mutant strain lacking ornithine decarboxylase protein. With the 
      antisera, we show that the inactivation of the enzyme in response to polyamines is 
      proportional to the loss of ornithine decarboxylase protein over almost 2 orders of 
      magnitude. This is similar to the inactivation process in certain mammalian tissues, 
      and different from the process in S. cerevisiae and P. polycephalum, in which enzyme 
      modification, without proportional loss of antigen, accompanies enzyme inactivation. 
      The N. crassa enzyme is therefore suitable as a microbial model for studies of the 
      molecular regulation of the mammalian enzyme.

AB  - In the present study, a cellular level response of Cyto-aa3 oxidation was 
      investigated in real time under both time-varying and strong static magnetic fields 
      of 5 T. Two kinds of cells, a slime mold, Physarum polycephalum, and bone forming 
      cells, MC-3T3-E1, were used for the experiments. The oxidation level of the Cyto-aa3 
      was calculated by optical absorptions at 690 nm, 780 nm and 830 nm. The sample, 
      fiber-optics and an additional optical fiber for light stimulation were set in a 
      solenoidal coil or the bore of a 5-T superconducting magnet. The solenoidal coil for 
      time-varying magnetic fields produced sinusoidal magnetic fields of 6 mT. The slime 
      mold showed a periodic change in Cyto-aa3 oxidation, and the oxidation-reduction 
      cycle of Cyto-aa3 was apparently changed when visible-light irradiated the slime 
      mold. Similarly to the case with light, time-varying magnetic stimulations changed 
      the oxidation-reduction cycle during and after the stimulation for 10 minutes. The 
      same phenomena were observed in the MC-3T3-E1 cell assembly, although their cycle 
      rhythm was comparatively random. Finally, magnetic field exposure of up to 5 T 
      exhibited a distinct suppression of Cyto-aa3 oscillation in the bone forming cells. 
      Exposure up to 5 T was repeated five times, and the change in Cyto-aa3 oxidation 
      reproducibly occurred.

AB  - Physarum Polycephalum is a single cell visible by unaided eye. This is a plasmodial, 
      vegetative stage of acellular slime mould. This single cell has myriad of nuclei 
      which contribute to a network of bio-chemical oscillators responsible for the slime 
      mould's distributed sensing, concurrent information processing and decision making, 
      and parallel actuation. When presented with a spatial configuration of sources of 
      nutrients, the slime mould spans the sources with networks of its protoplasmic tube. 
      These networks belong to a family of planar proximity graphs. The protoplasmic 
      networks also show a degree of similarity to vehicular transport networks. 
      Previously, we have shown that the foraging behaviour of the slime mould can be 
      applied in archaeological research to complement and enhance conventional geographic 
      information system tools. The results produced suffered from limitation of a flat 
      substrate: transport routes imitated by the slime mould did not reflect patterns of 
      elevations. To overcome the limitation of the 'flat world' we constructed a 
      three-dimensional model of Balkans. In laboratory experiments and computer modelling 
      we uncovered patterns of the foraging behaviour that might shed a light onto 
      development of Roman roads in the Balkans during the imperial period (1st century BC 
      - 4th century AD).

AB  - Protooncogene- and tumor-suppressor gene proteins serve essential functions in the 
      regulation of proliferation and differentiation of cells. Abnormal regulation or 
      mutation of these genes, or transformation with retroviral homologs, may lead to 
      tumor development in animals. In contrast to vertebrates, only few data on these 
      genes exist in plants and fungi. Plant nuclear protooncogene homologs, such as myb 
      and myc have multiple regulatory functions in metabolic pathways not existing in 
      mammalian cells; they are involved in the complex regulation of anthocyanin (purple 
      pigment) and phlobaphene (red pigment) biosynthesis, lignin production, trichome 
      differentiation, dehydration stress gene expression and seed development. Apart from 
      these well-characterized roles in plant-specific pathways, few experimental data 
      have been reported on a functional significance in growth and development. A 
      screening for nuclear protooncogene- and tumor-suppressor gene-related proteins in 
      the myxomycete Physarum polycephalum revealed the existence of homologs of 
      vertebrate c-myc, c-fos, c-jun, p53, and retinoblastoma proteins during the 
      synchronous cell cycle or sclerotization. The p53 homologs of Physarum and Zea mays 
      were shown to be specific for quiescent stages of their life cycles. Plants and 
      lower eukaryotes, such as fungi, may be useful experimental systems to elucidate 
      novel functions of protooncogene- and tumor-suppressor proteins in cell cycle 
      regulation and development, or to reveal target genes that might be difficult to 
      identify in complex mammalian systems. Recent data indicate that oncogenes and tumor 
      suppressors in animals have more cellular targets than originally proposed; some of 
      these might be as unexpected as in plant secondary metabolism.

PG  - 1151-7
AB  - The specific activity of uridine 5'-triphosphate:alpha-d-glucose 1-phosphate 
      uridyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.9) (also called uridine 5'-diphosphate [UDP]-glucose 
      pyrophosphorylase) has been found to increase up to eightfold during spherule 
      formation by the slime mold Physarum polycephalum. The enzyme accumulates during the 
      first 8 to 9 h after initiation of spherule formation, declines to basal levels 
      found in vegetative microplasmodia by 15 h, and is undetectable in completed 
      spherules. Specific activities for UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase in vegetative 
      microplasmodia range from 15 to 30 nmol of UDP-glucose formed per min per mg of 
      protein, whereas accumulated levels during spherule formation can attain a specific 
      activity as high as 125 nmol of UDP-glucose formed per min per mg of protein. The 
      scheduling and extent of accumulation are critically dependent on an early log-phase 
      age of microplasmodia originally induced to form spherules. Spherule induction by 
      0.2 M or 0.5 M mannitol delays this schedule in a variable and unpredictable manner. 
      Spherule-forming microplasmodia which have accumulated high levels of UDP-glucose 
      pyrophosphorylase spontaneously excrete the enzyme when transferred to salts medium 
      containing 0.2 M or 0.5 M mannitol. The excreted enzyme is subsequently destroyed or 
      inactivated. Studies with preferential inhibitors of macromolecular synthesis 
      indicate that accumulation of UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase requires concomitant 
      protein synthesis and prior ribonucleic acid synthesis.

      (mycolase III) are of low toxicity in mammals when given parenterally and are able 
      to cure experimental systemic fungal infections in mice when administered alone or 
      in conjunction with normally ineffective levels of conventional antimycotic drugs

TI  - Coordination of contractility, adhesion and flow in migrating Physarum amoebae.
LID - 10.1098/rsif.2014.1359 [doi]
LID - 20141359
AB  - This work examines the relationship between spatio-temporal coordination of 
      intracellular flow and traction stress and the speed of amoeboid locomotion of 
      microplasmodia of Physarum polycephalum. We simultaneously perform particle image 
      velocimetry and traction stress microscopy to measure the velocity of cytoplasmic 
      flow and the stresses applied to the substrate by migrating Physarum microamoebae. 
      In parallel, we develop a mathematical model of a motile cell which includes forces 
      from the viscous cytosol, a poro-elastic, contractile cytoskeleton and adhesive 
      interactions with the substrate. Our experiments show that flow and traction stress 
      exhibit back-to-front-directed waves with a distinct phase difference. The model 
      demonstrates that the direction and speed of locomotion are determined by this 
      coordination between contraction, flow and adhesion. Using the model, we identify 
      forms of coordination that generate model predictions consistent with experiments. 
      We demonstrate that this coordination produces near optimal migration speed and is 
      insensitive to heterogeneity in substrate adhesiveness. While it is generally 
      thought that amoeboid motility is robust to changes in extracellular geometry and 
      the nature of extracellular adhesion, our results demonstrate that coordination of 
      adhesive forces is essential to producing robust migration.

TI  - Ca2+-dependent actin-binding phosphoprotein in Physarum polycephalum. Subunit b is a 
      DNase I-binding and F-actin capping protein.
PG  - 5208-13
AB  - Physarum contains at least two distinct DNase I-binding proteins, i.e. actin and Cap 
      42 (a + b). The latter, a tight (1:1) complex of Cap 42 (a) and Cap 42 (b) (Maruta, 
      H., Isenberg. G., Schreckenbach, T., Hallmann, R., Risse, G., Schibayama, T., and 
      Hesse, J. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 10144-10150), is a Ca2+-dependent F-actin 
      capping protein. DNase I binds to Cap 42 (b) but not to Cap 42 (a). Consequently, 
      DNase I-agarose was used for an affinity-purification of Cap 42 (a + b), after its 
      separation from actin by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. Cap 42 (a + b) was 
      dissociated into its subunits when released from DNase I-agarose by 8.8 M formamide. 
      The two subunits were subsequently separated from each other on hydroxylapatite. 
      Both Cap 42 (a) and Cap 42 (b) were Ca2+-dependent F-actin capping proteins that cap 
      the fast growing end of actin filaments and block actin polymerization at this end. 
      Like Cap 42 (a + b), Cap 42 (b) required Ca2+ for its capping activity only when 
      phosphorylated. The phosphorylation of Cap 42 (b) was completely blocked by DNase I 
      or a tertiary complex of Cap 42 (a), actin, and Ca2+. Cap 42 (b) is not identical 
      with native (= polymerizable) actin because (i) Cap 42 (b) was unable to form 
      filaments, (ii) the Cap 42 (b) kinase did not phosphorylate native actin, and (iii) 
      fragmin formed a tight (1:1) complex with native actin but not with Cap 42 (b). 
      Although it is unlikely that Cap 42 (b) is simply a denatured form of actin that has 
      lost its polymerizability during the preparation, it still remains to be clarified 
      whether Cap 42 (b) is a nonpolmerizable actin variant derived from a distinct actin 
      gene or a post-translationally modified form of polymerizable actin.

TI  - Interaction of the intron-encoded mobility endonuclease I-PpoI with its target site.
PG  - 7531-9
AB  - Endonucleases encoded by mobile group I introns are highly specific DNases that 
      induce a double-strand break near the site to which the intron moves. I-PpoI from 
      the acellular slime mold Physarum polycephalum mediates the mobility of intron 3 (Pp 
      LSU 3) in the extrachromosomal nuclear ribosomal DNA of this organism. We showed 
      previously that cleavage by I-PpoI creates a four-base staggered cut near the point 
      of intron insertion. We have now characterized several further properties of the 
      endonuclease. As determined by deletion analysis, the minimal target site recognized 
      by I-PopI was a sequence of 13 to 15 bp spanning the cleavage site. The purified 
      protein behaved as a globular dimer in sedimentation and gel filtration. In gel 
      mobility shift assays in the presence of EDTA, I-PpoI formed a stable and specific 
      complex with DNA, dissociating with a half-life of 45 min. By footprinting and 
      interference assays with methidiumpropyl-EDTA-iron(II), I-PpoI contacted a 22- to 
      24-bp stretch of DNA. The endonuclease protected most of the purines found in both 
      the major and minor grooves of the DNA helix from modification by dimethyl sulfate 
      (DMS). However, the reactivity to DMS was enhanced at some purines, suggesting that 
      binding leads to a conformational change in the DNA. The pattern of DMS protection 
      differed fundamentally in the two partially symmetrical halves of the recognition 
      sequence.

TI  - Observations on an ATP-sensitive protein system from the plasmodia of a myxomycete.
PG  - 325-47
AB  - 1. Extracts of the plasmodia of the myxomycete, Physarum polycephalum, exhibit 
      reversible decreases in viscosity in response to the addition of ATP under 
      appropriate conditions. The protoplasm material prepared by extraction with KCl 
      solution can apparently exist in either a high or a low viscosity state. As 
      prepared, it is in the low viscosity condition. Rapid and extensive increases in 
      viscosity of the extract are brought about by addition of AMP, inorganic phosphate, 
      or, under certain conditions, of ATP. Only after the high viscosity state has been 
      attained does addition of appropriate quantities of ATP cause a reversible decrease 
      in viscosity. 2. The active principle of crude plasmodial extracts may be 
      concentrated by fractional precipitation with ammonium sulfate and is found in the 
      fraction precipitated between 30 and 40 per cent saturation. This material possesses 
      a higher viscosity than does the original crude extract and is apparently in the 
      high viscosity state since the addition of ATP causes an immediate reversible 
      decrease in viscosity. 3. The ATP-sensitive fraction of myxomycete plasmodia 
      possesses a viscosity which is dependent upon its previous thermal treatment. 
      Extracts incubated at 0 degrees for a period of a few hours increase greatly in 
      viscosity when they are returned to 24.5 degrees . This increased viscosity is 
      structural in nature, is destroyed by mechanical agitation of the solution, and may 
      be reversibly destroyed by addition of ATP. 4. It is suggested that the 
      ATP-responsive protein of myxomycete plasmodia may be related to sol-gel 
      transformations which have been observed in intact plasmodia and may participate in 
      the protoplasmic streaming of the intact organism. This suggestion is based upon the 
      following facts: (a) the protoplasmic streaming of myxomycete plasmodia is increased 
      by microinjection of ATP; (b) the gel portion of the cytoplasm at the site of the 
      microinjection of ATP is extensively converted to the sol state. The changes in 
      structure of the intact cytoplasm are thus similar in nature to the changes 
      exhibited in response to ATP by the purified ATP-sensitive protein. 5. The 
      ATP-sensitive protein of myxomycete plasmodia appears to undergo reversible 
      aggregation to form a high viscosity state. The function of ATP is to break down the 
      aggregates thus formed. Since a specific ATPase activity is associated with the 
      purified material, added ATP is gradually destroyed and recovery of viscosity 
      attends the spontaneous reconstitution of aggregates.

TI  - Degenerate DNA recognition by I-PpoI endonuclease.
PG  - 11-21
AB  - The I-PpoI endonuclease is encoded by a group I intron found in the slime mold 
      Physarum polycephalum. To initiate homing of its encoding intron, I-PpoI catalyzes a 
      specific double-stranded break within a 15-bp recognition site. The high substrate 
      specificities of I-PpoI and other homing endonucleases make these enzymes valuable 
      tools for genomic mapping and sequencing. Here, we report on the ability of I-PpoI 
      to cleave recognition sites that contain a wide variety of mutations generated 
      randomly or deliberately. We find that much degeneracy is tolerated within the 
      recognition site of I-PpoI. Few single substitutions prevent cleavage completely. In 
      addition, many sites with multiple substitutions are cleaved efficiently. In 
      contrast, deletions or insertions within the I-PpoI recognition site are detrimental 
      to catalysis, indicating that proper registry between the protein and its substrate 
      is critical. Finally, we find that the sequence of the flanking regions can 
      influence catalysis by I-PpoI. Thus, I-PpoI has both the complex binding specificity 
      of a transcription factor and the catalytic ability of a restriction endonuclease.

TI  - Reactivation of a cell-free model from Physarum polycephalum: studies on 
      cryosections indicate an inhibitory effect of Ca++ on cytoplasmic actomyosin 
      contraction.
PG  - 139-49
AB  - Cell-free models should offer "in situ conditions" to study the physiology of 
      cytoplasmic actomyosin in its natural environment, while, if possible, still 
      associated with its regulatory control proteins and other cytoplasmic components. 
      Detergents and glycerol as the usual media to permeabilize the plasmalemma and to 
      extract a portion of the cytoplasmic components, are accompanied by several 
      disadvantages. We investigated a cell-free model consisting of cryosections of 
      plasmodial strands that were previously enriched with "stress fibrils" and 
      fluorescently labelled with phallotoxins and that contain the non-denatured 
      structures that are to be reactivated in situ. The contraction reaction can be 
      directly observed in the fluorescence microscope. This procedure allows the study of 
      contraction conditions in the natural environment of the fibrils. The aim of these 
      reactivation experiments was to identify the role of calcium ions. According to our 
      results, a reactivation of cryosections is not Ca++ dependent but is partly 
      inhibited at concentrations of 10(-4) to 5 X 10(-2)M Ca++. Complete inhibition 
      occurs at 10 to 20 mM Ca++. Electron microscopical investigations revealed that the 
      fluorescently labelled contracting structures were identical to actomyosin fibrils.

TI  - Galvanotaxis of slime mold.
PG  - 1-16
AB  - The plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum reacts to direct current by migration toward 
      the cathode. Cathodal migration was obtained upon a variety of substrata such as 
      baked clay, paper, cellophane, and agar with a current density in the substratum of 
      1.0 microa./mm.(2) Injury was produced by current densities of 8.0 to 12.0 
      microa./mm.(2) The negative galvanotactic response was not due to electrode 
      products. Attempts to demonstrate that the response was due to gradients or 
      orientation in the substratum, pH changes in the mold, cataphoresis, electroosmosis, 
      or endosmosis were not successful. The addition of salts (CaCl(2), LiCl, NaCl, 
      Na(2)SO(4), NaHCO(3), KCl, MgSO(4), sodium citrate, and sea water) to agar indicated 
      that change of cations had more effect than anions upon galvanotaxis and that the 
      effect was upon threshold values. K ion (0.01 M KCl) increased the lower threshold 
      value to 8.0 microa./mm.(2) and the upper threshold value to 32.0 microa./mm.(2), 
      whereas the Li ion (0.01 M LiCl) increased the lower threshold to only 4.0 
      microa./mm.(2) and the upper threshold to only 16.0 microa./mm.(2) The passage of 
      electric current produced no increase in the rate of cathodal migration; neither was 
      there a decrease until injurious current densities were reached. With increase of 
      subthreshold current densities there was a progressive decrease in rate of migration 
      toward the anode until complete anodal inhibition occurred. There was orientation at 
      right angles to the electrodes in alternating current (60 cycle) with current 
      density of 4.0 microa./mm.(2) and in direct current of 5.0 microa./mm.(2) when 
      polarity of current was reversed every minute. It is concluded that the negative 
      galvanotactic response of P. polycephalum is due to inhibition of migration on the 
      anodal side of the plasmodium and that this inhibition results in the limitation of 
      the normal migration of the mold to a cathodal direction. The mechanism of the 
      anodal inhibition has not been elucidated.

      Actin Filament Fragmenting Protein.
PG  - 215-25
AB  - We report the isolation and characterization of an Echinococcus granulosus gene that 
      codes for a protein with actin filament fragmenting and nucleating activities 
      (EgAFFP). The genomic region corresponding to the EgAFFP gene presents a coding 
      sequence of 1110 bp that is interrupted by eight introns. The EgAFFP deduced amino 
      acid sequence is about 40% homologous to those of several members of the gelsolin 
      family, such as Physarum polycephalum fragmin, Dictyostelium discoideum severin, and 
      Lumbricus terrestris actin modulator. As do other proteins of the same family, 
      EgAFFP presents three repeated domains, each one characterized by internal conserved 
      amino acid motifs. Assays with fluorescence-labeled actin showed that the 
      full-length recombinant EgAFFP effectively binds actin monomers in both a 
      calcium-dependent and calcium-independent manner and also presents actin nucleating 
      and severing activities.

TI  - Actin kinase: a protein kinase that phosphorylates actin of fragmin-actin complex.
PG  - 366-70
AB  - Actin of fragmin-actin complex is phosphorylated by an endogenous kinase from 
      plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum. The phosphorylation abolishes the nucleation 
      and capping activities of fragmin-actin complex. The kinase has been purified and 
      termed actin kinase [Furuhashi, K. & Hatano, S. (1990) J. Cell Biol. 111, 
      1081-1087]. Enzymatic properties of the purified actin kinase were studied in 
      detail. Actin kinase exhibited the highest activity under conditions physiological 
      for the plasmodium (30 mM KCl, 6 mM MgCl2, pH 7.0). The Vmax and the Km of the 
      enzyme for ATP were about 83 mumol/min/mg and 25 microM, respectively. The Km for 
      fragmin-actin complex was 190 nM. The purified actin kinase phosphorylated actin of 
      fragmin-actin complex at a constant rate regardless of Ca2+ concentration. 
      Similarly, 2 microM cAMP, 2 microM cGMP, 2 micrograms/ml calmodulin in the presence 
      of Ca2+ or 1 mM GTP showed no effect on the activity of the purified enzyme. Actin

      discoideum.
PG  - 95-103
AB  - Changes in protein-bound mono(ADP-ribose) residues during development of 
      Dictyostelium discoideum were determined. NAD(H) levels and the amounts of the NH2OH 
      resistant and sensitive subfractions of mono(ADPR) were found not to be different 
      between exponentially growing and aggregation-competent cells in which mitosis had 
      ceased. Divergent changes occurred at the differentiation stages following 
      aggregation as indicated by an increase in the ratio of these subfractions from 
      approx. 1 during the growth plase and aggregation competent stage to 2 in the grex, 
      a stage which follows cell aggregation. The fraction of NH2OH sensitive conjugates 
      closely followed the changes in total cellular protein, while the NH2OH resistant 
      ADPR protein conjugates, when based on protein, increased during the stages 
      following aggregation. NAD(H) and NADP(H) levels per unit DNA decreased 
      significantly during this period. The mono(ADPR) to DNA ratio in D. discoideum is 
      comparable to that in proliferating Physarum polycephalum and to non-proliferating 
      adult rat liver. The total amount of mono(ADPR) residues per nucleus is, however, 
      approximately 70-fold higher in the liver, indicating that the quantity of 
      mono(ADPR) residues is more closely related to the size of the eukaryotic genome 
      than to cell proliferation.

TI  - A gene upregulated in the acoustically damaged chick basilar papilla encodes a novel 
      WD40 repeat protein.
PG  - 59-69
AB  - The chick WDR1 gene is expressed at higher levels in the chick basilar papilla after 
      acoustic overstimulation. The 3.3-kb WDR1 cDNA encodes a novel 67-kDa protein 
      containing nine WD40 repeats, motifs that mediate protein-protein interactions. The 
      predicted WDR1 protein has high sequence identity to WD40-repeat proteins in budding 
      yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), two slime molds (Dictyostelium discoideum and 
      Physarum polycephalum), and the roundworm (Caenorhabditis elegans). The yeast and P. 
      polycephalum proteins bind actin, suggesting that the novel chick protein may be an 
      actin-binding protein. Sequence database comparisons identified mouse and human 
      cDNAs with high sequence identity to the chick WDR1 cDNA. The mouse Wdr1 and human 
      WDR1 proteins showed 95% sequence identity to each other and 86% identity to the 
      chick WDR1 protein. Northern blot analysis of total RNA from the chick basilar 
      papilla after noise trauma revealed increased levels of a 3.1-kb transcript in the 
      lesioned area. The WDR1 gene was mapped to human chromosome 4, between 22 and 24 cM 
      from the telomere of 4p.

PG  - 369-74
LID - 10.1007/s00203-014-0971-5 [doi]
AB  - The morphogenesis of plasmodium in Didymium megalosporum was observed for the first 
      time by hanging drop culture and 3 % oat-agar culture under controlled conditions. 
      The development of plasmodium was characteristic formation process of 
      phaneroplasmodium. The mature plasmodium was white yellow or yellow green in color, 
      and had an extending fan-like sheet at the front, followed by a network of veins. It 
      could be easy to fuse into a bigger plasmodium during the formation and die at high 
      temperature or starvation. In view of the important role of alpha-tubulin during the 
      morphogenesis of plasmodium, we sequenced partial sequence of alpha-tubulin gene, a 
      total length of 1,159 bp, in this plasmodium. It had an intron area from 177 to 
      235 bp, and the exon area had a similarity of 91 % relative to altA locus of 
      alpha-tubulin gene in Physarum polycephalum, the translated amino acid sequence was 
      identical (100 % match) between the two.

TI  - DNA methylation in the fungi.
PG  - 8033-6
AB  - A systematic study on the incidence and patterns of cytosine methylation in the 
      fungi has been carried out by restriction and nearest-neighbor analysis of DNAs 
      isolated from undifferentiated cells of several fungal species. With respect to DNA 
      modification, the fungi appear to be a heterogeneous group, with a 5-methylcytosine 
      content ranging from undetectable levels (less than or equal to 0.1% of cytosine 
      residues methylated in 18 out of 20 species tested) to low but detectable levels 
      (e.g. congruent to 0.2 and congruent to 0.5% of the total cytosines methylated in 
      Sporotrichum dimorphosporum and Phycomyces blakesleeanus, respectively). In the 
      species where it has been detected, 5-methylcytosine is located mostly at CpG 
      doublets, and the methylated sites are clustered in long tracts (10-30 kilobase 
      pairs) separated from essentially unmethylated regions. This methylated compartment, 
      which comprises a small fraction (1-11%) of the total DNA, contains at least a 
      specific set of repetitive sequences. These results contrast with the higher 
      5-methylcytosine content found in the fungus Physarum polycephalum and in 
      vertebrates and higher plants.

TI  - Polyamine-mediated protein phosphorylations: a possible target for intracellular 
      polyamine action.
PG  - 247-66
AB  - Polyamines are well-known ubiquitous components of living cells. Although these 
      polycations have been implicated in the regulation of major cellular functions such 
      as DNA, RNA and protein synthesis occurring during cellular proliferation and/or 
      differentiation processes, their mechanism of action at the molecular level has 
      remained obscure. On the other hand, protein phosphorylation has emerged as a 
      regulatory process of prime importance in cellular regulation. Data have recently 
      been presented suggesting that polyamines may express at least part of their 
      biological action through an effect upon selective protein phosphorylation systems. 
      Two types of polyamine-sensitive protein kinases have been characterized in the last 
      few years. The best known in molecular terms is the widespread casein kinase G (also 
      termed casein kinase II), which represents a multifunctional protein kinase, at 
      present classified as a messenger-independent activity. The other is a 
      polyamine-dependent nuclear ornithine decarboxylase kinase characterized in Physarum 
      polycephalum and several mammalian tissues. Both protein kinases are activated by 
      polyamines in vitro at concentrations compatible with a physiological role, by a 
      mechanism which most likely also involves an effect through the protein substrate 
      conformation. Preliminary evidence suggests that both kinases may be implicated in 
      the regulation of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase activities, although several other 
      potential substrates have been suggested for casein kinase G. Another suggestion is 
      that these kinases may also participate in the post-translational regulation of 
      ornithine decarboxylase, the rate-limiting step in the polyamine biosynthetic 
      pathway. A novel class of protein kinase activities may thus be defined as 
      polyamine-mediated phosphorylation systems for which polyamines may function as 
      intracellular messenger. Although their biological significance remains to be fully 
      established, especially with regard to the definition of their specific 
      intracellular target(s) and subsequent biological functions, these systems will be 
      interesting to consider in future studies aimed at understanding the role of 
      polyamines in cell regulation.

TI  - Modulation of the epsilon-(gamma-glutamic)lysine cross-link in cellular proteins. I. 
      In vivo and in vitro studies.
PG  - 167-76
AB  - The epsilon-(gamma-glutamic)lysine cross-link content of intracellular proteins in a 
      variety of cell types can be modulated in vivo by temperature changes and in vitro 
      by treatment with Mg2+/-ATP and Mg2+/-ATP plus Ca2+. Virtually all the cross-links 
      are found in the cytoskeletal and membrane components which are not solubilized by 
      glycerol extraction. In the slime mold, Physarum polycephalum, enzyme activities 
      persist which bring about a decrease in cross-link content upon addition of 
      Mg2+/-ATP and an increase in cross-link content upon addition of Mg2+/-ATP plus 
      Ca2+. In cultured embryonic chick skeletal myofibrils, we have observed a decrease 
      in cross-link content upon addition of Mg2+/-ATP. In cultured embryonic chick heart 
      myofibrils, we have observed an increase in cross-link content upon addition of 
      Mg2+/-ATP followed by Ca2+. A hypothesis is discussed in which the modulation of 
      Glu-Lys cross-links is explained in terms of a cycle of reactions which involves (1) 
      the formation of an acyl phosphate of a glutamic acid side chain; (2) the formation 
      of a Glu-Lys cross-link, and (3) the hydrolytic or phosphorylitic breakdown of the 
      cross-links. In such a hypothesis, the role of Mg2+/-ATP is that of introducing 
      energy which can be used for the cycling of cross-links and possibly for some 
      cellular energy transductions.

AB  - Tritiated α-amanitin has been used as a specific and sensitive probe to estimate the 
      number of RNA polymerase B molecules in isolated nuclei, chromatin and nucleoids, 
      obtained from macroplasmodia ofPhysarum polycephalum. During mitosis (metaphase±10 
      min) there is at least 10-fold less RNA polymerase B than at all phases of the cell 
      cycle, even if DNA replication has been blocked in vivo. It is concluded that many 
      of the RNA polymerase B molecules leave the chromatin during decondensation of the

TI  - Polymorphisms and intronic structures in the 18S subunit ribosomal RNA gene of the 
      fungi Scytalidium dimidiatum and Scytalidium hyalinum. Evidence of an IC1 intron 
      with an His-Cys endonuclease gene.
PG  - 455-67
AB  - The fungi Scytalidium dimidiatum (Nattrassia mangiferae synanamorph) and Scytalidium 
      hyalinum are mainly encountered in (sub)tropical areas as plant pathogens and agents 
      of human dermatomycosis. Because the classification and differentiation of these two 
      species is unclear, we studied 22 S. dimidiatum and 15 S. hyalinum isolates in order 
      to identify potential species-specific insertions and polymorphisms in the 18S 
      subunit ribosomal gene. The presence of an IE intron in S. dimidiatum, together with 
      a single polymorphism (A in S. dimidiatum, G in S. hyalinum) in the coding region, 
      allowed us to differentiate these two species in most cases. Moreover, in one S. 
      dimidiatum isolate we found a group IC1 intron containing a putative truncated 
      His-Cys endonuclease gene. This enzyme shows strong similarity to the intronic 
      homing endonuclease of Physarum polycephalum. Based on these results and our 
      previous findings, we propose an evolutionary pathway for 18S rDNA S. dimidiatum 
      insertions, implying independent events.

TI  - Fourier-based spatial mapping of oscillatory phenomena in fungi.
PG  - 1077-84
AB  - Microorganisms display a range of oscillatory phenomena that operate over different 
      temporal scales. Fourier analysis provides a compact description of such 
      oscillations in terms of their frequency, magnitude and phase. However, in the 
      majority of studies there is no explicit consideration of the spatial organisation 
      of the oscillation. Here we describe procedures and a software package to map 
      oscillatory phenomena in microorganisms in both the time and frequency domains. Key 
      parameters of interest, such as frequency, phase or magnitude of the oscillations, 
      are presented as pseudo-colour coded maps. This maintains the spatial information in 
      the image and greatly facilitates understanding of potentially complex propagating 
      waves or development of oscillatory domains with distinct behaviour. We illustrate 
      the utility of this system with reference to spatial analysis of the pulsatile 
      component to amino acid transport in mycelial systems of Phanerochaete velutina and 
      Coniophora puteana, and actin-myosin based contractions in Physarum polycephalum.

TI  - Intron within the large rRNA gene of N. crassa mitochondria: a long open reading 
      frame and a consensus sequence possibly important in splicing.
PG  - 509-20
AB  - We describe the sequence of the 2295 nucleotide long intron and 245 nucleotides of 
      the flanking exon sequences within the large (24S) rRNA gene of Neurospora crassa 
      mitochondria. The intron contains a long open reading frame, which could correspond 
      to ribosomal protein S5. Comparison with the corresponding intron of the large rRNA 
      gene of yeast mitochondria reveals a single highly homologous 57 nucleotide long 
      sequence, including the sequence (formula; see text), which is present in virtually 
      all the sequenced introns of yeast, Aspergillus nidulans and Zea mays mitochondrial 
      genes, and which may be important for their processing. Sequences closely related to 
      this consensus sequence are also present within all four of the introns of nuclear 
      rRNA genes which have been sequenced. The intron is located within a highly 
      conserved region of the large rRNA sequence and at exactly the same site as in the 
      corresponding introns in yeast mitochondria and also in Physarum polycephalum 
      nuclei.

TI  - cDNA of YP4, a follicular epithelium yolk protein subunit, in the moth, Plodia 
      interpunctella.
PG  - 157-64
AB  - YP4, a subunit of the follicular epithelium yolk protein in the moth, Plodia 
      interpunctella, is produced in the follicle cells during vitellogenesis and after 
      secretion is taken up into the oocyte and stored in the yolk spheres for utilization 
      during embryogenesis. In order to identify the cDNA clones for YP4, a degenerate PCR 
      primer was designed to six amino acid residues identified in the NH2-terminal 
      sequence of mature YP4. The YP4 degenerate primer plus T7 reverse PCR primer 
      produced a PCR product from a cDNA library for the majority of the YP4 coding 
      sequence. Combined cDNA and 5' RACE sequencing showed the YP4 transcript to be 991 
      bp in length with a single open reading frame for a predicted polypeptide of 299 
      amino acids. Northern analysis showed a single YP4 transcript was present in ovarian 
      RNA that was approximately 1 kb in length. The predicted amino acid sequence for YP4 
      from P. interpunctella was most closely related to the predicted YP4 protein from 
      the moth, Galleria mellonella, and the spherulin 2a protein from the slime mold, 
      Physarum polycephalum.

TI  - Generation of highly site-specific DNA double-strand breaks in human cells by the 
      homing endonucleases I-PpoI and I-CreI.
PG  - 88-93
AB  - We have determined the ability of two well-characterized eukaryotic homing 
      endonucleases, I-PpoI from the myxomycete Physarum polycephalum and I-CreI from the 
      green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, to generate site-specific DNA double-strand 
      breaks in human cells. These 18-kDa proteins cleave highly conserved 15- or 24-bp 
      rDNA homing sites in their respective hosts to generate homogeneous 4-base, 3' ends 
      that initiate target intron transposition or "homing." We show that both 
      endonucleases can be expressed in human cells and can generate site-specific DNA 
      double-strand breaks in 28S rDNA and homing site plasmids. These 
      endonuclease-induced breaks can be repaired in vivo, although break repair is 
      mutagenic with the frequent generation of short deletions or insertions. I-PpoI and 
      I-CreI should be useful for analyzing DNA double-strand break repair in human cells 
      and rDNA.

TI  - A comparative survey of the function, mechanism and control of cellular oscillators.
PG  - 217-79
AB  - This review attempts to survey in a uniform manner the available evidence concerning 
      the generation and behaviour of several well-investigated cellular oscillators. 
      Members of two broad classifications are contrasted: (i) cytoplasmic oscillations, 
      where the periodic phenomena is generated by an instability pathway and (ii) 
      membrane oscillators in which a membrane potential rhythm is generated at the 
      membrane. Interactions between the cytoplasmic and membrane compartments are 
      considered and the effects of these interactions on oscillatory behaviour is 
      discussed. Because of their biological importance and the greater body of 
      experimental results, particular attention is directed to a study of membrane 
      potential oscillations. These systems can be approximately classified in two groups: 
      (i) systems in which a periodic potential results from oscillatory changes in 
      permeability and (ii) systems in which potential oscillations result from the 
      periodic activity of an electrogenic pump. The examples considered include the 
      glycolytic oscillator, oscillations in vein contraction in the slime mould Physarum 
      polycephalum, rhythmic aggregation in Dictyostelium discoideum, neural oscillators, 
      the periodic potential in Purkinje fibres and the sino-atrial node and rhythmic 
      behaviour in smooth muscle. Questions considered include the generation of periodic 
      activity, the modulation of the oscillation by drugs and other metabolic and 
      membrane effectors and the question of the functional role of these oscillations.

TI  - Microfilament dynamics: regulation of actin polymerization by actin-fragmin kinase 
      and phosphatases.
PG  - 199-227
AB  - Based on the phosphorylation of the purified actin-fragmin complex, an 80 kDa 
      monomeric kinase (AFK) has been isolated from Physarum polycephalum. Protein 
      chemical analysis and studies involving kinase inhibitors and effectors establish 
      that the AFK is a unique kinase that cannot be classified so far in one of the 
      conventional kinase families. The actin-fragmin kinase behaves as an "independent" 
      kinase since its activity towards the actin-fragmin complex is apparently not 
      regulated by the binding of a ligand (e.g., the cyclic-nucleotides, Ca2+, 
      calmodulin, phosphatidylserine and diolein). Rigorous screening of the substrate 
      specificity suggests that the actin-fragmin complex represents the only substrate 
      for this kinase. This kinase phosphorylates the actin moiety of the actin-fragmin 
      complex at two consecutive threonine residues which constitute one of the contact 
      sites for DNase I (37) and which are also located at one of the proposed actin-actin 
      contact sites along the long-pitch helix of F-actin (38, 39). The physiological 
      importance of this phosphorylation was demonstrated by studying the effect of 
      phosphorylation on the nucleation and the capping activity of the actin-fragmin 
      complex using fluorescence enhancement analysis. As could be demonstrated, the 
      nucleation of actin filaments by the actin-fragmin complex is completely abolished 
      upon phosphorylation by the AFK. Phosphorylation of the complex also interferes with 
      its capping activity, which becomes Ca(2+)-dependent. In addition, capping and 
      nucleating activity is regulated in vitro by phosphoinositides, of which PIP2 
      displays the highest activity and specificity. PIP2 partially inhibits the 
      nucleation and capping activity of the unphosphorylated actin-fragmin. The capping 
      activity of the phosphorylated actin-fragmin complex was inhibited by PIP2 to a much 
      greater extent as compared to the unphosphorylated actin-fragmin complex. Among all 
      phospholipids tested, PIP2 displayed the highest specificity. Initial experiments 
      with purified preparations of the PP-1, PP-2A, PP-2B, alkaline phosphatase and acid 
      phosphatases showed that PP-1 and PP-2A phosphatases were capable of 
      dephosphorylating the phospho actin-fragmin complex. These findings raised the 
      question of whether these or other protein phosphatases were involved in the 
      dephosphorylation of this substrate in vivo. To address this question, Physarum 
      extracts were subjected to fractionation by ion exchange chromatography, and the 
      column fractions were assayed in a variety of conditions, to identify the protein 
      phosphatases involved in the dephosphorylation of this substrate and to identify the 
      elution position of the major Ser/Thr protein phosphatases present in the Physarum 
      extract.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

TI  - Widespread occurrence of anti-troponin T crossreactive components in non-muscle 
      cells.
PG  - 1-19
AB  - Using a monoclonal antibody generated against striated muscle troponin T, we 
      previously noted the presence of crossreactive components in smooth muscle and 
      non-muscle cells. Since the presence of troponin T in tissues other than striated 
      muscle is controversial, we sought to establish the nature of the crossreaction and 
      to determine the extent of its occurrence. For this study, indirect 
      immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoblot analyses were performed. Crossreactive 
      material was found in diverse cells from the animal, plant and fungal kingdoms. On 
      the basis of morphological distributions, both microtubule-associated and 
      non-microtubule-associated components were revealed. Microtubule-associated 
      components of animal cell lines included a 35 X 10(3) Mr protein, similar in 
      electrophoretic mobility to skeletal troponin T (37 X 10(3) Mr). Reactive components 
      of comparable mobility were observed in immunoblots of brain and cerebellar 
      homogenates. Filamentous staining was observed in a variety of mammalian cells in 
      culture and in cells of vertebrate tissues. Chick cerebellar tissue showed reactions 
      in the neurites of the molecular layer and granule cell bodies. In the plant 
      kingdom, examination of the onion root-tip cells indicated an association of 
      crossreactive components with interphase cortical microtubules, preprophase bands, 
      the mitotic spindle and phragmoplast microtubules. In the fungal kingdom, both 
      interphase and mitotic spindle microtubules in a cellular slime mould were reactive. 
      Non-microtubule-associated components were observed in the centrosphere regions of 
      mitotic sea-urchin eggs, in mitotic and interphase plasmodia of Physarum 
      polycephalum, and in trichocysts and basal bodies of Paramecium tetraurelia. In all 
      systems examined, the troponin T crossreactive components were located in regions or 
      on structures of possible Ca2+ or calmodulin activity, suggesting a possible 
      functional similarity to troponin T.

TI  - Inhibition of maize histone deacetylases by HC toxin, the host-selective toxin of 
      Cochliobolus carbonum.
PG  - 1941-50
AB  - HC toxin, the host-selective toxin of the maize pathogen Cochliobolus carbonum, 
      inhibited maize histone deacetylase (HD) at 2 microM. Chlamydocin, a related cyclic 
      tetrapeptide, also inhibited HD activity. The toxins did not affect histone 
      acetyltransferases. After partial purification of histone deacetylases HD1-A, HD1-B, 
      and HD2 from germinating maize embryos, we demonstrated that the different enzymes 
      were similarly inhibited by the toxins. Inhibitory activities were reversibly 
      eliminated by treating toxins with 2-mercaptoethanol, presumably by modifying the 
      carbonyl group of the epoxide-containing amino acid Aeo 
      (2-amino-9,10-epoxy-8-oxodecanoic acid). Kinetic studies revealed that inhibition of 
      HD was of the uncompetitive type and reversible. HC toxin, in which the epoxide 
      group had been hydrolyzed, completely lost its inhibitory activity; when the 
      carbonyl group of Aeo had been reduced to the corresponding alcohol, the modified 
      toxin was less active than native toxin. In vivo treatment of embryos with HC toxin 
      caused the accumulation of highly acetylated histone H4 subspecies and elevated 
      acetate incorporation into H4 in susceptible-genotype embryos but not in the 
      resistant genotype. HDs from chicken and the myxomycete Physarum polycephalum were 
      also inhibited, indicating that the host selectivity of HC toxin is not determined 
      by its inhibitory effect on HD. Consistent with these results, we propose a model in 
      which HC toxin promotes the establishment of pathogenic compatibility between C. 
      carbonum and maize by interfering with reversible histone acetylation, which is 
      implicated in the control of fundamental cellular processes, such as chromatin 
      structure, cell cycle progression, and gene expression.

TI  - A mutant beta-tubulin confers resistance to the action of benzimidazole-carbamate 
      microtubule inhibitors both in vivo and in vitro.
PG  - 449-55
AB  - The mutant BEN210 of Physarum polycephalum is highly resistant to a number of 
      benzimidazole carbamate agents, including methylbenzimidazole-2-yl-carbamate and 
      parbendazole. The resistance is conferred by the benD210 mutation in a structural 
      gene for beta-tubulin. This mutant allele encodes a beta-tubulin with novel 
      electrophoretic mobility. We have used this strain to determine whether the mutant 
      beta-tubulin is used in microtubules and whether this usage permits microtubule 
      polymerisation in the presence of drugs both in vivo and in vitro. In vitro assembly 
      studies of tubulin purified from the mutant strain have shown that microtubules are 
      formed both in the absence of drugs and in all drug concentrations tested (up to 50 
      microM parbendazole). In contrast, the assembly of microtubules from wild-type 
      tubulin in vitro is totally inhibited by 2-5 microM parbendazole. Thus the 
      resistance of BEN210 to parbendazole observed in vivo has been reproduced in vitro 
      using tubulin purified from the mutant strain. Electrophoretic analysis of the 
      microtubules formed in vitro has shown that both the wild-type and the mutant 
      beta-tubulin are incorporated into the microtubules and that the proportion of 
      mutant to wild-type beta-tubulin appears to remain constant with increasing drug 
      concentration. This is the first demonstration of a single mutation in a tubulin 
      structural gene causing an altered function of the gene product in vitro.

AB  - The acellular slime mold Physarum polycephalum provides an excellent model to study 
      network formation, as its network is remodelled constantly in response to mass 
      gain/loss and environmental conditions. How slime molds networks are built and fuse 
      to allow for efficient exploration and adaptation to environmental conditions is 
      still not fully understood. Here, we characterize the network organization of slime 
      molds exploring homogeneous neutral, nutritive and adverse environments. We 
      developed a fully automated image analysis method to extract the network topology 
      and followed the slime molds before and after fusion. Our results show that: (1) 
      slime molds build sparse networks with thin veins in a neutral environment and more 
      compact networks with thicker veins in a nutritive or adverse environment; (2) slime 
      molds construct long, efficient and resilient networks in neutral and adverse 
      environments, whereas in nutritive environments, they build shorter and more 
      centralized networks; and (3) slime molds fuse rapidly and establish multiple 
      connections with their clone-mates in a neutral environment, whereas they display a 
      late fusion with fewer connections in an adverse environment. Our study demonstrates 
      that slime mold networks evolve continuously via pruning and reinforcement, adapting 
      to different environmental conditions.

TI  - Analysis of the internal nuclear matrix. Oligomers of a 38 kD nucleolar polypeptide 
      stabilized by disulfide bonds.
PG  - 139-53
AB  - When rat liver nuclei are treated with the sulfhydryl cross-linking reagent sodium 
      tetrathionate (NaTT) prior to nuclease treatment and extraction with 1.6 M NaCl, 
      residual nucleoli and an extensive non-chromatin intranuclear network remain 
      associated with the nuclear envelope. Subsequent treatment of this structure with 1 
      M NaCl containing 20 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) solubilizes the intranuclear material, 
      while the nuclear envelope remains structurally intact. We have isolated and 
      partially characterized a major polypeptide of the disulfide-stabilized internal 
      nuclear matrix. The polypeptide, which has an apparent molecular mass 38 kD and 
      isoelectric point 5.3, has been localized to the nucleolus of rat liver nuclei by 
      indirect immunofluorescence using a specific polyclonal chicken antiserum. Based on 
      its molecular mass, isoelectric point, intracellular localization and amino acid 
      composition, the 38 kD polypeptide appears to be analogous to the nucleolar 
      phosphoprotein B23 described by Prestayko et al. (Biochemistry 13 (1974) 1945) [20]. 
      Immunologically related polypeptides have likewise been localized to the nucleoli of 
      both hamster and human tissue culture cell lines as well as the cellular slime mold 
      Physarum polycephalum. By immunoblotting, a single 38 kD polypeptide is recognized 
      by the antiserum in rat, mouse, hamster and human cell lines. The antiserum has been 
      utilized to investigate the oligomeric structure of the 38 kD polypeptide and the 
      nature of its association with the rat liver nuclear matrix. By introducing varying 
      numbers of disulfide bonds, we have found that the 38 kD polypeptide becomes 
      incorporated into the internal nuclear matrix in a two-step process. Soluble 
      disulfide-bonded homodimers of the polypeptide are first formed and then are 
      rendered salt-insoluble by more extensive disulfide cross-linking.

      technique of fluorography a fluor (e.g., PPO) is infiltrated into the gel where it 
      can absorb the radiation and re-emit light that will pass through the gel to the 
      film. The resulting photographic image is analogous to an autoradiograph, but for a 
      low energy beta-emitting isotope like (3)H, the sensitivity of fluorography is many 
      times the sensitivity of autoradiography. The fluorograph may be used directly, as a 
      qualitative picture of the radioactivity on the gel. It may also be used to locate 
      radioactive bands or spots that can then be cut from the original gel for further 
      analysis, or be scanned to give quantitative information about the distribution of 
      radioactivity. Figure 1 shows an example of a gel that was stained with Coomassie 
      blue and then fluorographed. Notice that there is no loss of resolution in the 
      fluorography of thin gels of normal size. Fig. 1. This shows two examples of 
      fluorography of protein bands labeled with (3)H. Basic nuclear proteins were 
      isolated from the slime mold, Physarum polycephalum, pulse-labeled with (3)H-acetate 
      in either S phase or G(2) phase of the naturally synchronous cell cycle. The 
      proteins were analyzed by acrylamide gel electrophoresis in acetic acid, urea, and 
      Triton X-100. After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with Coomassie blue, 
      photographed, and then fluorographed. Individual lanes of the gel image were cut 
      from the photograph (negative) and the fluorograph and then printed side-by-side to 
      give the figure shown. Notice that the stain patterns of the two lanes are 
      practically identical, except for the loading, while the radioactivity patterns show 
      major differences, for example, the absence of label in his-tones H2A and H2B in G2 
      phase (4).

TI  - Clathrin is involved in organization of mitotic spindle and phragmoplast as well as 
      in endocytosis in tobacco cell cultures.
PG  - 1-11
AB  - We previously identified a 175 kDa polypeptide in Lilium longiflorum germinating 
      pollen using a monoclonal antibody raised against myosin II heavy chain from 
      Physarum polycephalum. In the present study, the equivalent polypeptide was also 
      found in cultured tobacco BY-2 cells. Analysis of the amino acid sequences revealed 
      that the 175 kDa polypeptide is clathrin heavy chain and not myosin heavy chain. 
      After staining of BY-2 cells, punctate clathrin signals were distributed throughout 
      the cytoplasm at interphase. During mitosis and cytokinesis, clathrin began to 
      accumulate in the spindle and the phragmoplast and then was intensely concentrated 
      in the cell plate. Expression of the C-terminal region of clathrin heavy chain, in 
      which light chain binding and trimerization domains reside, induced the suppression 
      of endocytosis and the formation of an aberrant spindle, phragmoplast, and cell 
      plate, the likely cause of the observed multinucleate cells. These data strongly 
      suggest that clathrin is intimately involved in the formation of the spindle and 
      phragmoplast, as well as in endocytosis.

TI  - Mutations Increasing Asexual Plasmodium Formation in PHYSARUM POLYCEPHALUM.
PG  - 401-20
AB  - Rare plasmodia formed in clones of heterothallic amoebae were analyzed in a search 
      for mutations affecting plasmodium formation. The results show that the proportion 
      of mutants varies with both temperature (18 degrees , 26 degrees or 30 degrees ) and 
      mating-type allele (mt1, mt2, mt3, mt4). At one extreme, only one of 33 plasmoida 
      formed by mt2 amoebae at 18 degrees is mutant. At the other extreme, three of three 
      plasmodia formed by mt1 amoebae at 30 degrees are mutant. The mutant plasmodia fall 
      into two groups, the GAD (greater asexual differentiation) mutants and the ALC 
      (amoebaless life cycle) mutants. The spores of GAD mutants give rise to amoebae that 
      differentiate into plasmodia asexually at much higher frequencies than normal 
      heterothallic amoebae. Seven of eight gad mutations analyzed genetically are linked 
      to mt and one (gad-12) is not. The gad-12 mutation is expressed in strains with 
      different alleles of mt. The frequency of asexual plasmodium formation is heat 
      sensitive in some (e.g., mt3 gad-11 ), heat-insensitive in two (mt2 gad-8 and mt2 
      gad-9) and cold-sensitive in one (mt1 gad-12) of twelve GAD mutants analyzed 
      phenotypically. The spores of ALC mutants give rise to plasmodia directly, thereby 
      circumventing the amoebal phase of the life cycle. Spores from five of the seven ALC 
      mutants give rise to occasional amoebae, as well as plasmodia. The amoebae from one 
      of the mutants carry a mutation (alc-1) that is unlinked to mt and is responsible 
      for the ALC phenotype in this mutant. Like gad-12, alc-1 is expressed with different 
      mt alleles. Preliminary observations with amoebae from the other four ALC mutants 
      suggest that two are similar to the one containing alc-1; one gives rise to 
      revertant amoebae, and one gives rise to amoebae carrying an alc mutation and a 
      suppressor of the mutation.

TI  - Identification of a novel PSR as the substrate of an SR protein kinase in the true 
      slime mold.
PG  - 275-83
LID - 10.1093/jb/mvq141 [doi]
AB  - Here, a novel cDNA encoding a serine/arginine (SR)-rich protein, designated PSR, was 
      isolated from the true slime mold Physarum polycephalum and expressed in Escherichia 
      coli. The deduced amino acid (aa) sequence reveals that PSR contains RS repeats at 
      its C-terminus, similar to the conventional PSRPK substrate ASF/SF2. To study the 
      novel protein, we generated a variety of mutant constructs by PCR and site-directed 
      mutagenesis. Our analysis indicated that the purified recombinant PSR was 
      phosphorylated by PSRPK in vitro and the SR-rich domain (amino acids 460-469) in the 
      PSR protein was required for phosphorylation. In addition, removal of the docking 
      motif (amino acids 424-450) from PSR significantly reduced the overall catalytic 
      efficiency of the phosphorylation reaction. We also found that the conserved 
      ATP-binding region (62)LGWGHFSTVWLAIDEKNGGREVALK(86) and the serine/threonine 
      protein kinases active-site signature (184)IIHTDLKPENVLL(196) of PSRPK played a 
      crucial role in substrate phosphorylation and Lys(86) and Asp(188) were crucial for 
      PSRPK phosphorylation of PSR. These results suggest that PSR is a novel SR-related 
      protein that is phosphorylated by PSRPK.

TI  - Effect of mycolase and amphotericin B on Candida albicans and Candida 
      pseudotropicalis in vitro and in vivo.
PG  - 147-64
AB  - A mixture of enzymes (mycolase) capable of lysing yeast cell walls was prepared from 
      culture filtrates of Physarum polycephalum. The enzymes present in mycolase included 
      chitinase, beta-1,3-glucanases and exo-glycosidases. The pH optima of these enzymes 
      were in the range 3.5-5.0 and they had low activities at pH 7.0. Mycolase produced 
      spheroplasts from Candida pseudotropicalis and, unlike commercial enzyme 
      preparations such as L1, chitinase, beta, 1,3-glucanase and beta-glucosidase, had 
      some candicidal activity in vitro against C. pseudotropicalis and C. albicans. 
      Mycolase potentiated the antifungal activity of amphotericin B against C. 
      pseudotropicalis grown in shake flask culture but did not potentiate the antifungal 
      activity of the antibiotic against similar cultures of C. albicans; indeed 
      antagonism between mycolase and amphotericin B was sometimes observed with the 
      latter yeast. Mycolase caused an approximately two-fold increase in the total and 
      viable counts of cultures of C. albicans inoculated with stationary phase cells. 
      These increases, which were observed within about 30 min, were attributed to 
      mycolase inducing the premature release of viable buds from 'lag' phase cells. 
      Mycolase also increased the rate at which C. albicans formed germ tubes when the 
      yeast was cultured in a medium containing serum. Mycolase alone or in combination 
      with amphotericin B did not appreciably enhance phagocytosis or intracellular 
      killing of the yeasts by unstimulated mouse peritoneal macrophages. Studies on mice 
      infected systemically with C. albicans showed that mycolase only slightly enhanced 
      amphotericin B therapy.

TI  - Myosin heavy chain kinase inactivated by Ca2+/calmodulin from aggregating cells of 
      Dictyostelium discoideum.
PG  - 535-42
AB  - Soluble myosin heavy chain kinases (MHC kinases) were partially purified from growth 
      phase and aggregation-competent cells of Dictyostelium discoideum. In the 
      aggregation-competent cells, two MHC kinases were distinguishable. One of these 
      enzymes, called MHC kinase II, was inactivated by Ca2+ and calmodulin in a highly 
      temperature-dependent reaction. A MHC kinase found in growth phase cells did not 
      have these regulatory properties. Substrate specificities were analysed for MHC 
      kinase II and for the MHC kinase from growth phase cells. Both enzymes 
      phosphorylated threonine residues of the myosin heavy chains of D. discoideum and 
      Physarum polycephalum. Phosphopeptide mapping of D. discoideum myosin and 
      determination of the stoichiometry of its phosphorylation suggested the presence of 
      two phosphorylation sites per heavy chain. Both sites were contained within a 38-kd 
      chymotryptic fragment. The inactivation of MHC kinase II by Ca2+ plus calmodulin 
      suggests this enzyme has a role in the regulation of myosin functions during the 
      chemotactic response of a cell. The phosphorylated myosin had about one third the 
      actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity of the non-phosphorylated myosin. Previous 
      findings indicated that stimulation of D. discoideum cells with the chemo-attractant 
      cAMP increases the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration. Under these conditions MHC kinase 
      II might be inhibited and the dephosphorylated, more active form of myosin would 
      accumulate.

TI  - Distribution studies on polytene chromosomes using antibodies directed against 
      hnRNP.
PG  - 18-24
AB  - The distribution of nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) particles in Drosophila 
      polytene chromosomes has been investigated using anti-B-36 serum as a probe. The use 
      of polytene chromosomes allows resolution at the level of the chromomere, and 
      provides the opportunity to look for both positive and negative correlations with 
      transcriptional activity. The antiserum was obtained using the nuclear protein B-36 
      from Physarum polycephalum as the immunogen. It has been shown to precipitate hnRNP 
      particles from HeLa cells through a cross-reaction with the major 32,000- and 
      34,000-dalton hnRNP particle proteins. The antiserum cross-reacts with a Drosophila 
      nuclear protein of approximately 34,000 daltons. By indirect immunofluorescence, we 
      observed that the antiserum reacts preferentially with transcriptionally active loci 
      of the polytene chromosomes, whereas loci previously or subsequently active do not 
      show significant fluorescence. The overall pattern of fluorescence is very similar 
      to that generated with anti-RNA polymerase B serum. The correlation of fluorescence 
      and transcriptional activity observed suggests that the anti-B-36 serum is 
      recognizing hnRNP proteins which have combined with nascent RNA molecules at the 
      sites of transcription.

TI  - Monofunctional DNA-platinum(II) adducts block frequently DNA polymerases.
PG  - 2307-12
AB  - The question of whether monofunctional DNA platinum(II) adducts block synthesis of 
      DNA by purified DNA polymerases of different types and origin has been investigated 
      by comparing the time dependence of synthesis arrest and of DNA adduct formation. 
      Activated salmon testis DNA is used as a suitable substrate for DNA synthesis 
      allowing to probe inhibition by platinum(II) monoadducts for the variety of inherent 
      template-primers. Reaction amplitudes are related to defined mixtures of dichloro 
      and chloroaqua platinum(II) complexes. It is found that (i) all investigated DNA 
      polymerases seem arrested (100% efficiency) at bifunctional DNA adducts. (ii) human 
      DNA polymerase beta bypasses most of the monofunctional lesions of the three 
      platinum(II) complexes investigated. (iii) Klenow fragment is blocked by monoadducts 
      with increasing efficiency in the order cis-diamminechloroaquaplatinum(II) (0%) less 
      than meso-[1,2-bis(2,6- dichloro-4-hydroxyphenyl)ethylenediamine] 
      chloroaquaplatinum(II) (50%) less than trans-diamminechloro-aquaplatinum(II) (75%). 
      (iv) Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase, Physarum 
      polycephalum DNA polymerase alpha, and calf thymus DNA polymerase alpha appear to be 
      arrested by monoadducts. According to these examples, blocking efficiencies depend 
      on the cis/trans-stereogeometry of fixation of the carrier ligands at platinum(II) 
      residues, on the size/chemical nature of the platin(II) carrier ligand and on the 
      type/origin of DNA polymerase.

AB  - Dictyostelia are common soil microbes that can aggregate when starved to form 
      multicellular fruiting bodies, a characteristic that has also led to their long 
      history of study and widespread use as model systems. Ribosomal RNA phylogeny of 
      Dictyostelia identified four major divisions (Groups 1-4), none of which correspond 
      to traditional genera. Group 1 was also tentatively identified as sister lineage to 
      the other three Groups, although not consistently or with strong support. We tested 
      the dictyostelid root using universal protein-coding genes identified by exhaustive 
      comparison of six completely sequenced dictyostelid genomes, which include 
      representatives of all four major molecular Groups. A set of 213 genes are low-copy 
      number in all genomes, present in at least one amoebozoan outgroup taxon 
      (Acanthamoeba castellanii or Physarum polycephalum), and phylogenetically congruent. 
      Phylogenetic analysis of a concatenation of the deduced protein sequences produces a 
      single topology dividing Dictyostelia into two major divisions: Groups 1+2 and 
      Groups 3+4. All clades in the tree are fully supported by maximum likelihood and 
      Bayesian inference, and all alternative roots are unambiguously rejected by the 
      approximately unbiased (AU) test. The 1+2, 3+4 root is also fully supported even 
      after deleting clusters with strong individual support for this root, or 
      concatenating all clusters with low support for alternative roots. The 213 
      putatively ancestral amoebozoan proteins encode a wide variety of functions 
      including 21 KOG categories out of a total of 25. These comprehensive analyses and 
      consistent results indicate that it is time for full taxonomic revision of 
      Dictyostelia, which will also enable more effective exploitation of its unique 
      potential as an evolutionary model system.

TI  - Structural implications of novel diversity in eucaryal RNase P RNA.
PG  - 739-51
AB  - Previous eucaryotic RNase P RNA secondary structural models have been based on 
      limited diversity, representing only two of the approximately 30 phylogenetic 
      kingdoms of the domain Eucarya. To elucidate a more generally applicable structure, 
      we used biochemical, bioinformatic, and molecular approaches to obtain RNase P RNA 
      sequences from diverse organisms including representatives of six additional 
      kingdoms of eucaryotes. Novel sequences were from acanthamoeba (Acathamoeba 
      castellanii, Balamuthia mandrillaris, Filamoeba nolandi), animals (Caenorhabditis 
      elegans, Drosophila melanogaster), alveolates (Theileria annulata, Babesia bovis), 
      conosids (Dictyostelium discoideum, Physarum polycephalum), trichomonads 
      (Trichomonas vaginalis), microsporidia (Encephalitozoon cuniculi), and diplomonads 
      (Giardia intestinalis). An improved alignment of eucaryal RNase P RNA sequences was 
      assembled and used for statistical and comparative structural analysis. The analysis 
      identifies a conserved core structure of eucaryal RNase P RNA that has been 
      maintained throughout evolution and indicates that covariation in size occurs 
      between some structural elements of the RNA. Eucaryal RNase P RNA contains regions 
      of highly variable length and structure reminiscent of expansion segments found in 
      rRNA. The eucaryal RNA has been remodeled through evolution as a simplified version 
      of the structure found in bacterial and archaeal RNase P RNAs.

TI  - Tubulin diversity in trophozoites of Giardia lamblia.
PG  - 323-31
AB  - Giardia lamblia is a diplomonad that parasitizes the small intestine of vertebrates. 
      The trophozoite is multiflagellar and its cytoskeleton presents a complex 
      organization of microtubular structures. One of these, the adhesive disk, consists 
      of a microtubular spiral. The median body, whose function is not yet determined, is 
      also composed by microtubules. The cell has eight flagella and two microtubule 
      sheets, known as the funis. In this study we used several antibodies and 
      immunofluorescence microscopy to help in the characterization of these structures. 
      We observed that Giardia tubulin reacts with antibodies raised against very distinct 
      immunogens. The antibodies used were against: (1) alpha-tubulin from chicken embryo 
      brain, Trypanosoma brucei, sea urchin sperm, Paramecium, acetylated alpha-tubulin 
      from Paramecium, and tyrosinated alpha-tubulin, (2) beta-tubulin from chicken embryo 
      brain and Physarum polycephalum, and (3) an antibody with specificity to 
      beta-tubulin having as immunogen the FtsZ bacterial protein. Each cytoskeletal 
      structure of Giardia presented a distinct pattern of labeling by the several 
      antibodies used. These data indicate that even being considered one of the most 
      ancient of organisms, Giardia shares similarities (at least in relation to tubulin) 
      with other organisms. They also open some questions about the organization and 
      composition of its microtubular structures.

TI  - Immunoquantitation and size determination of intrinsic poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 
      from acid precipitates. An analysis of the in vivo status in mammalian species and 
      in lower eukaryotes.
PG  - 6993-9
AB  - Antibodies against pig thymus poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase were obtained with 
      enzyme-hemocyanin conjugates and used for immunoquantitation. The quick-blot 
      procedure used allowed the determination of amounts as low as 1 ng of enzyme from 
      whole cell trichloracetic acid precipitates. When applied to analysis of various 
      human, rodent, and bovine cell types, surprisingly similar amounts of polymerase 
      were found (1-5 ng of pig thymus polymerase equivalents/micrograms of DNA, 2 X 10(5) 
      polymerase molecules/HeLa cell). Also, no significant difference was seen between 
      normal and transformed cells. Polymerase tended to decline in several fibroblast 
      cultures upon reaching confluency, which was not reflected by total polymerase 
      activity. Divergence between total activity and immunogenic equivalents was also 
      seen in alkylated cells and in rat liver treated with phenobarbital. Trichloroacetic 
      acid-insoluble fractions dissolved in sodium dodecyl sulfate buffer could also be 
      used to analyze, by Western blotting, the size distribution of poly(ADP-ribose) 
      polymerase in vivo. Application to various cell types revealed that all mouse and 
      rat cells tested had two immunogenic bands (116 and 98 kDa) of similar intensity. A 
      highly conserved structure of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase may be deduced from the 
      existence of immunogenic and renaturable 116-kDa polypeptide bands even in the low 
      eukaryotes Physarum polycephalum and Dictyostelium discoideum.

TI  - Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton of mammalian cells by the capping complex 
      actin-fragmin is inhibited by actin phosphorylation and regulated by Ca2+ ions.
PG  - 1695-706
AB  - Fragmin from Physarum polycephalum is a gelsolin-like actin-binding protein and 
      interferes with the growth of actin filaments in vitro by severing actin filaments 
      and capping their barbed ends through formation of an actin-fragmin dimer in a 
      Ca2+-dependent manner. The actin-fragmin dimer is phosphorylated in vivo and in 
      vitro on the actin subunit by the actin-fragmin kinase. We have studied the 
      properties of these capping proteins and their regulation by actin phosphorylation 
      and Ca2+ ions in living PtK2, CV1 and NIH3T3 cultured cells by microinjection or by 
      expression in conjunction with immunostaining and fluorescence microscopy. 
      Microinjection of the actin-fragmin dimer disintegrated the actin cytoskeleton and 
      altered cell morphology. This in vivo effect could be blocked by phosphorylation of 
      the actin subunit by the actin-fragmin kinase in low Ca2+ conditions, and the 
      capping activity could be recovered by high Ca2+ concentration, probably through 
      activation of the second actin-binding site in fragmin. This suggests that in 
      Physarum microplasmodia, actin polymerization can be controlled in a Ca2+-dependent 
      manner through the phosphorylation of actin. Microinjected or overexpressed 
      recombinant fragmin did not affect the actin-based cytoskeleton or cell morphology 
      of resting cells, unless the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration was increased by 
      microinjection of a Ca2+-containing buffer. The cells were able to revert to their 
      normal phenotype which indicates that endogenous regulatory mechanisms counteracted 
      fragmin activity, probably by uncapping fragmin from the barbed ends of filaments. 
      Fragmin also antagonized formation of stress fibers induced by lysophosphatidic 
      acid. Our findings demonstrate that the interactions between actin and fragmin are 
      tightly regulated by the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and this provides a basis for 
      a more general mechanism in higher organisms to regulate microfilament organization.

      polycephalum amoebae: mannitol-induced detergent-resistant cells are not true cysts.

AB  - Previous workers reported thatPhysarum polycephalum amoebae cultured in liquid 
      axenic medium were induced to form cysts by the addition of mannitol. Their 
      criterion for encystment was the formation of detergent (Triton)-resistant cells 
      (TRC). In this study the frequencies of TRC in suspensions of amoebae from various 
      treatments were compared with counts of cell types identified by transmission 
      electron microscopy. Amoebae treated with mannitol in axenic liquid culture formed 
      50% TRC after 17 h but no walled cysts were found. It was concluded that TRC induced 
      by mannitol were dense, rounded cells without walls. In contrast, TRC formed after 
      growth to stationary phase on bacterial lawns were walled cells. When resuspended in 
      growth medium, most mannitol-induced TRC reverted to active amoebae within a few 
      minutes, whereas TRC formed on bacteria remained Triton resistant for many hours. It 
      was concluded that delayed reversion of TRC was a more reliable indication of wall 
      formation than Triton resistance alone. Transfer of amoebae from liquid culture to 
      the surface of diluted axenic agar medium resulted in the formation of walled cysts 
      identical in appearance with those formed on bacterial lawns. The results indicated 
      that efficient encystment requires a solid substratum as well as nutrient 
      deprivation.

TI  - A structural analysis of P. polycephalum U1 RNA at the RNA and gene levels. Are 
      there differentially expressed U1 RNA genes in P. polycephalum? U1 RNA evolution.
PG  - 1019-34
AB  - U1 RNAs were isolated from P. polycephalum microplasmodia nuclei and sequenced. A P. 
      polycephalum gene coding for U1 RNA was also isolated. The coding region of this 
      gene differs at 3 positions compared to the isolated U1 RNA species. Both isolated 
      RNAs and the gene encoded RNA can be folded according to the secondary structure 
      model previously proposed for U1 RNA. Putative regulatory elements very similar to 
      those required for efficient transcription of U RNA genes from vertebrates, in 
      particular, the -200 distal enhancer element, are present in the flanking regions of 
      this gene. The presence of several U1 RNA genes in P. polycephalum was confirmed by 
      Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA. In contrast to yeast S. cerevisiae U1 RNA, P. 
      polycephalum U1 RNAs have a length similar to that of U1 RNAs from higher 
      eukaryotes. Nevertheless, P. polycephalum U1 RNAs probably differ from these RNAs in 
      the 5'-terminal segment supposed to base-pair with the 5'-end of introns. The 
      results are discussed taking into account phylogenetic evolution and functional role 
      of U1 RNA.

TI  - Molecular and biochemical characterization of a novel actin bundling protein in 
      Acanthamoeba.
PG  - 331-41
AB  - Actin binding proteins play key roles in cell structure and movement particularly as 
      regulators of the assembly, stability and localization of actin filaments in the 
      cytoplasm. In the present study, a cDNA clone encoding an actin bundling protein 
      named as AhABP was isolated from Acanthamoeba healyi, a causative agent of 
      granulomatous amebic encephalitis. This clone exhibited high similarity with genes 
      of Physarum polycephalum and Dictyostelium discoideum, which encode actin bundling 
      proteins. Domain search analysis revealed the presence of essential conserved 
      regions, i.e., an active actin binding site and 2 putative calcium binding EF-hands. 
      Transfected amoeba cells demonstrated that AhABP is primarily localized in 
      phagocytic cups, peripheral edges, pseudopods, and in cortical cytoplasm where 
      actins are most abundant. Moreover, AhABP after the deletion of essential regions 
      formed ellipsoidal inclusions within transfected cells. High-speed co-sedimentation 
      assays revealed that AhABP directly interacted with actin in the presence of up to 
      10 microM of calcium. Under the electron microscope, thick parallel bundles were 
      formed by full length AhABP, in contrast to the thin actin bundles formed by 
      constructs with deletion sites. In the light of these results, we conclude that 
      AhABP is a novel actin bundling protein that is importantly associated with actin 
      filaments in the cytoplasm.

TI  - Substrate binding and turnover by the highly specific I-PpoI endonuclease.
PG  - 1076-83
AB  - Intron-encoded endonucleases are distinguished by their ability to catalyze the 
      cleavage of double-stranded DNA with high specificity. I-PpoI endonuclease, an 
      intron-encoded endonuclease from the slime mold Physarum polycephalum, is a small 
      enzyme (2 x 20 kDa) that catalyzes the cleavage of a large asymmetric DNA sequence 
      (15 base pairs). Here, the interactions of I-PpoI with its substrate were examined 
      during both binding (in the absence of Mg2+) and catalysis (in the presence of 
      Mg2+). Using circular permutation assays, I-PpoI was shown to bend its substrate by 
      38 +/- 4 degrees upon binding. Two independent methods, gel mobility shift assays 
      and fluorescence polarization assays, revealed that I-PpoI binds tightly to its 
      substrate. Values of Kd range from 3.3 to 112 nM, increasing with increasing NaCl 
      concentration. Similar salt effects on the values of Km were observed during 
      steady-state catalysis. At low salt concentrations, the value of kcat/Km for the 
      cleavage of an oligonucleotide duplex approaches 10(8) M-1 s-1. Although other 
      divalent cations can replace Mg2+, catalysis by I-PpoI is most efficient in the 
      presence of an oxophilic metal ion that prefers an octahedral geometry: Mg2+ > Mn2+ 
      > Ca2+ = Co2+ > Ni2+ > Zn2+. Together, these results provide the first chemical 
      insight into substrate binding and turnover by an intron-encoded endonuclease.

TI  - Dictyostelium discoideum essential myosin light chain: gene structure and 
      characterization.
PG  - 83-94
AB  - We have used a Dictyostelium essential myosin light chain (EMLC) cDNA clone to 
      isolate additional cDNA clones which supply a different 3' sequence from that 
      previously described. The revised cDNA sequence encodes a polypeptide of 150 amino 
      acids. Amino acid residues 147-167 of the previously reported sequence are replaced 
      by new residues 147 to 150. The new cDNA encodes a polypeptide with 66% amino acid 
      sequence identity with the Physarum polycephalum EMLC, and approximately 30% 
      identity with mammalian EMLC sequences. These new cDNA clones were used to isolate 
      two genomic DNA fragments which contain the entire EMLC gene. The Dictyostelium EMLC 
      gene contains a single intron located immediately 3' of the translation initiation 
      codon and encodes a product most similar to MLC3 isoform of vertebrates. Primer 
      extension analysis places the transcription initiation site approximately 90 
      nucleotides upstream of the translation initiation site. A DNA fragment containing 
      350 bases of sequence upstream of the putative transcription initiation site is 
      sufficient to drive expression of a reporter gene upon reintroduction into growing 
      Dictyostelium cells. In addition, the CAT reporter mRNA produced by this construct 
      showed a pattern of developmental regulation similar to that previously reported for 
      the endogenous EMLC mRNA. Based on comparison with published EMLC sequences from a 
      variety of sources, the Dictyostelium EMLC shows slightly higher similarity to 
      vertebrate EMLCs from striated muscle sources than nonmuscle sources. While 
      Dictyostelium and human nonmuscle sequences display only 28% identity over their 
      entire sequence, the region from residue 88 to 108 shows much higher identity (67%). 
      The high evolutionary conservation of this region of the EMLC suggests it may play 
      an important role in EMLC function, and as such, represents a good target for future 
      mutagenesis studies.

TI  - Interacting domains of P14-3-3 and actin involved in protein-protein interactions of 
      living cells.
PG  - 651-63
LID - 10.1007/s00203-011-0707-8 [doi]
AB  - 14-3-3 proteins are conserved regulatory proteins present in all eukaryotic cells 
      that control numerous cellular activities via targeted protein interactions. To 
      elucidate the interaction between P14-3-3 from Physarum polycephalum and actin in 
      living cells, PCR and DNA recombination were used to generate various P14-3-3 and 
      actin constructs. Yeast two-hybrid assay and FRET were employed to characterize the 
      interaction between P14-3-3 and actin. The two-hybrid assay indicated that P14-3-3 
      N-terminal 76-108 amino acids and the C-terminal 207-216 amino acids played an 
      important role in mediating interactions with actin, and the actin N-terminal 1-54 
      amino acids and the C-terminal 326-376 amino acids are also crucial in the 
      interactions with the mPa, a P14-3-3 with mutations at Ser62 (Ser62 → Gly62). 
      Mutations to potential phosphorylation sites did not affect interactions between 
      P14-3-3 and actin. FRET results demonstrated that P14-3-3 co-localized with actin 
      with a FRET efficiency of 22.2% and a distance of 7.4 nm and that P14-3-3 N-terminal 
      76-108 and C-terminal 207-216 amino acids were important in mediating this 
      interaction, the truncated actin peptides without either the N-terminal 1-54 or 
      C-terminal 326-376 amino acids interacted with P14-3-3, consistent with the results 
      obtained from the yeast two-hybrid assay. Based on data obtained, we identified 
      critical actin and P14-3-3 contact regions.

TI  - Two monoclonal antibodies to actin: one muscle selective and one generally reactive.
PG  - 349-62
AB  - Two IgG1, kappa monoclonal antibodies (Mab) against actin have been obtained from a 
      fusion in which chicken gizzard actin was used as the immunogen. One Mab, designated 
      B4, shows a preferential reactivity toward enteric smooth muscle actin but also 
      cross-reacts with skeletal, cardiac, and aorta actins on the basis of immunoblots, 
      ELISA assays, and indirect immunofluorescence. However, this antibody does not react 
      with either cytoplasmic actin in any of these assay systems. A second Mab, 
      designated C4, reacts with all six known vertebrate isoactins as well as 
      Dictyostelium discoideum and Physarum polycephalum actins. Thus B4 Mab appears to 
      react with an epitope that is at least partially shared among the muscle actins but 
      not found in cytoplasmic actins, while C4 Mab binds to an antigenic determinant that 
      has been highly conserved among the actins. The binding sites of both Mabs on 
      skeletal actin overlap that of pancreatic DNase I. Both antibodies bind a SV8 
      proteolytic product comprising the amino-terminal two-thirds of the actin molecule, 
      and their epitopes appear to overlap since C4 can compete for the binding of B4 to 
      skeletal actin. Neither antibody is able to prevent actin polymerization.

TI  - Autocatalytic RNA cleavage in the human beta-globin pre-mRNA promotes transcription 
      termination.
PG  - 526-30
AB  - New evidence indicates that termination of transcription is an important regulatory 
      step, closely related to transcriptional interference and even transcriptional 
      initiation. However, how this occurs is poorly understood. Recently, in vivo 
      analysis of transcriptional termination for the human beta-globin gene revealed a 
      new phenomenon--co-transcriptional cleavage (CoTC). This primary cleavage event 
      within beta-globin pre-messenger RNA, downstream of the poly(A) site, is critical 
      for efficient transcriptional termination by RNA polymerase II. Here we show that 
      the CoTC process in the human beta-globin gene involves an RNA self-cleaving 
      activity. We characterize the autocatalytic core of the CoTC ribozyme and show its 
      functional role in efficient termination in vivo. The identified core CoTC is highly 
      conserved in the 3' flanking regions of other primate beta-globin genes. 
      Functionally, it resembles the 3' processive, self-cleaving ribozymes described for 
      the protein-encoding genes from the myxomycetes Didymium iridis and Physarum 
      polycephalum, indicating evolutionary conservation of this molecular process. We 
      predict that regulated autocatalytic cleavage elements within pre-mRNAs may be a 
      general phenomenon and that functionally it may provide the entry point for 
      exonucleases involved in mRNA maturation, turnover and, in particular, 
      transcriptional termination.

TI  - Calcium-induced conformational changes in Leishmania infantum kinetoplastid membrane 
      protein-11.
PG  - 107-17
AB  - Total-reflection X-ray fluorescence has been used to study whether the Leishmania 
      infantum kinetoplastid membrane protein-11 is a Ca2+-binding protein. The 108 amino 
      acid helix-loop-helix protein has the loop region located between residues 45 and 
      57, having similarity to the EF-hand motifs. In particular, the sequence alignment 
      of the putative motif revealed the existence of 67% similarity and 33% identity with 
      the EF-hand of the plasmodia-specific 40-kDa protein from Physarum polycephalum. To 
      address the type of conformational changes induced by Ca2+ binding, circular 
      dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy were used. The data showed that Ca2+ induces 
      changes in both the secondary and tertiary structure of the protein in a 
      temperature- and pH-dependent way. It also induces the precipitation of the protein 
      at pH 7.5, in contrast with what occurs at pH 5.0, and the precipitation process can 
      be reverted by addition of EGTA. At acidic pH values the complex EGTA-Ca2+ causes 
      drastic structural changes, forcing the protein to adopt a structure close to that 
      of a random coil. Because, at acidic pH values, protein:Ca2+:EGTA ternary complexes 
      may be formed, the drastic change may be attributed to the presence of a high 
      density of EGTA negative charges in the neighborhood of the alpha-helices.

TI  - Characterization and primary structure of a base non-specific and acid ribonuclease 
      from Dictyostelium discoideum.
PG  - 848-56
AB  - A base non-specific and acid RNase was isolated from cellular slime mold 
      (Dictyostelium discoideum) cells in a homogeneous state (about 2.4 kDa) by 
      SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The RNase (RNase DdI) has a pH optimum of 
      5.0. The amino acid sequence of RNase DdI was determined by a combination of protein 
      chemistry, a search of Data base, Dicty cDB and further sequence analysis of cDNA 
      from the same bank. RNase DdI consists of 198 amino acid residues, and about 13.3, 
      0.9, 1.2, 3.3, and 1.0 residues of mannose, xylose, glucose, GlcNAc, and GalNAc, 
      respectively. RNase DdI has two characteristic conserved segments of the RNase T2 
      family, and thus belongs to the RNase T2 family. Considering the fact that most of 
      the RNase activity of D. discoideum is present in the lysosomal fraction [Wiener and 
      Ashworth (1970) Biochem. J. 118, 505-512], it was concluded that the lysosomal RNase 
      in D. discoideum is a member of the RNase T2 family. The amino acid sequence of 
      RNase DdI is highly homologous with that of Physarum polycephalum RNase (RNase 
      Phyb), and its amino acid sequence seems to be similar to those of plant/animal type 
      RNases, rather than fungal RNases. The location of RNase DdI in the phylogenetic 
      tree of the RNase T2 family was estimated.

TI  - Different levels of DNA modification at 5'CCGG in murine erythroleukemia cells and 
      the tissues of normal mouse spleen.
PG  - 4305-20
AB  - The DNA of a Friend erythroleukemic cell line (clone DS-19) and that of mouse spleen 
      from which it was derived were compared with respect to modification at 5'CCGG. 
      Methylation patterns in clone DS-19 DNA were very different from those in normal 
      spleen DNA. Our results suggest that the mechanism by which the internal cytosine in 
      the 5'CCGG sequence is modified has been partially inactivated in clone DS-19. We 
      observed a general decrease of about two-fold in total modification at this site in 
      DS-19 DNA. This general decrease was shown to extend to 5'CCGG sites in specific 
      classes of repeated sequences with two-dimensional displays of restriction 
      fragments. Interspersed repeated sequences which are concertedly modified (i.e., 
      modified at many different chromosomal locations) in spleen, were found to be 
      unmodified at these locations in the cell line. However, we did not detect a 
      difference in DNA modification at 5'CCGG with these techniques when uninduced and 
      hexamethylene-bis-acetamide (HMBA) induced cells of clone DS-19 were compared. In 
      other experiments, we obtained further evidence that selected classes of repeated 
      sequences in Physarum polycephalum are methylated to the same extent independent of 
      chromosomal location.

AB  - Optical imaging has rapidly evolved in the last decades. Sophisticated microscopes 
      allowing optical sectioning for three-dimensional imaging or sub-diffraction 
      resolution are available. Due to price and maintenance issues, these microscopes are 
      often shared between users in facilities. Consequently, long-term access is often 
      prohibited and does not allow to monitor slowly evolving biological systems or to 
      validate new models like organoids. Preliminary coarse long-term data that do not 
      require acquisition of terabytes of high-resolution images are important as a first 
      step. By contrast with expensive all-in-one commercialized stations, standard 
      microscopes equipped with incubator stages offer a more cost-effective solution 
      despite imperfect long-run atmosphere and temperature control. Here, we present the 
      Incubascope, a custom-made compact microscope that fits into a table-top incubator. 
      It is cheap and simple to implement, user-friendly and yet provides high imaging 
      performances. The system has a field of view of 5.5 × 8 mm(2), a 3 μm resolution, a 
      10 frames per second acquisition rate, and is controlled with a Python-based 
      graphical interface. We exemplify the capabilities of the Incubascope on biological 
      applications such as the hatching of Artemia salina eggs, the growth of the slime 
      mould Physarum polycephalum and of encapsulated spheroids of mammalian cells.

AB  - Poly(A) RNA from S phase, G(2) phase and starved macroplasmodia of Physarum contain 
      mRNA sequences which when translated in vitro, yield similar patterns of 
      polypeptides after fluorography.Reassociation of nick-translated DNA (Cot) allows 
      the isolation of highly labeled single copy DNA which, after saturation 
      hybridization with poly(A) RNA, gives values of 23% for growth and 17% for 
      starvation.Homologous cDNA/poly(A) RNA hybridization reactions (Rot) indicate that 
      22-28% of the genome is transcribed during growth and 12% during starvation and that 
      about half of the cDNA reacts with 0.1% of the genome and could represent 50-80 RNA 
      species, each present in about 1,000 copies per nucleus. Up to 25,000 different RNA 
      species, 1-5 copies each per nucleus, are estimated to be present during growth, and 
      about 15,000 during starvation. Heterologous cDNA/poly(A) RNA hybridization 
      reactions (Rot) indicate that the RNA sequences in S and G(2) phase of the cell 
      cycle are similar, with RNA sequences being more abundant in G(2) phase.During 
      starvation about 25% of the sequences present during growth cannot be detected and 
      those sequences present during growth have become diluted during starvation.

TI  - Oligomerization state in solution of the cell cycle regulators p13suc1 from the 
      fission yeast and p9cksphy from the myxomycete Physarum, two members of the cks 
      family.
PG  - 145-50
AB  - The cks proteins (for cdc2 kinase subunit) are essential cell cycle regulators. They 
      interact strongly with the mitotic cdc2 kinase, but the mechanism and the biological 
      function of this association still await understanding. The oligomerization state in 
      solution of two members of this ubiquitous protein family, the suc1 gene product 
      from the fission yeast and the newly cloned cksphy gene product from the myxomycete 
      Physarum, was investigated by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and biochemical 
      methods. We found that the major molecular species are monodispersed monomeric 
      proteins. Minor amounts of dimeric suc1 proteins were also found, but no equilibrium 
      between the two forms was observed and surprisingly, the hexameric assemblies 
      observed in the crystal structure of the human ckshs2 homolog were not detected. 
      These apparent discrepancies between proteins that display cross-complementation 
      address the question of the control of the cks oligomerization process and its link 
      to the biological function.

TI  - Specific and nonspecific enzymes involved in the catabolism of mononucleoside and 
      dinucleoside polyphosphates.
PG  - 117-39
AB  - This review concerns enzymes that can degrade nucleoside 5'-tetra- and 
      pentaphosphates (p(4)N and p(5)N) and those that can degrade various dinucleoside 
      polyphosphates (Np(3-6)N'). Most of these enzymes are hydrolases, and they occur in 
      all types of organisms. Certain fungi and protozoa also possess specific Np(n)N' 
      phosphorylases. Specific p(4)N hydrolases have been demonstrated in mammals and in 
      plants. In yeast, p(4)N and p(5)N are hydrolyzed by exopolyphosphatases. Among other 
      hydrolases that can degrade these minor mononucleotides are phosphatases, apyrase, 
      and (asymmetrical) Np(4)N' hydrolase, as well as the nonspecific adenylate 
      deaminase. Np(n)N's are good substrates for Type I phosphodiesterases and nucleotide 
      pyrophosphatases, and diadenosine polyphosphates are easily deaminated to diinosine 
      polyphosphates by nonspecific adenylate deaminases. Specific Np(3)N' hydrolases 
      occur in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Interestingly, the human fragile histidine 
      triad (Fhit) tumor suppressor protein appears to be a typical Np(3)N' hydrolase. 
      Among the specific Np(4)N' hydrolases are asymmetrically cleaving ones, which are 
      typical of higher eukaryotes, and symmetrically cleaving enzymes found in Physarum 
      polycephalum and in many bacteria. An enzyme that hydrolyzes both diadenosine 
      tetraphosphate and diadenosine triphosphate has been found in the fission yeast 
      Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Its amino acid sequence is similar to that of the human 
      Fhit/Np(3)N' hydrolase. Very recently, a typical (asymmetrical) Np(4)N' hydrolase 
      has been demonstrated for the first time in a bacterium-the pathogenic Bartonella 
      bacilliformis. Another novelty is the discovery of diadenosine 5', 5"'-P(1),P 
      6-hexaphosphate hydrolases in budding and fission yeasts and in mammalian cells. 
      These enzymes and the (asymmetrical) Np(4)N' hydrolases have the amino acid motif 
      typical of the MutT (or Nudix hydrolase) family. In contrast, the 
      Schizosaccharomyces pombe Ap(4)A/Ap(3)A hydrolase, the human Fhit protein, and the 
      yeast Np(n)N' phosphorylases belong to a superfamily GAFH, which includes the 
      histidine triad proteins.

TI  - Chemical mechanism of DNA cleavage by the homing endonuclease I-PpoI.
PG  - 16178-86
AB  - Homing endonucleases are distinguished by their ability to catalyze the cleavage of 
      double-stranded DNA with extremely high specificity. I-PpoI endonuclease, a homing 
      endonuclease from the slime mold Physarum polycephalum, is a small enzyme (2 x 20 
      kDa) of known three-dimensional structure that catalyzes the cleavage of a long 
      target DNA sequence (15 base pairs). Here, a detailed chemical mechanism for 
      catalysis of DNA cleavage by I-PpoI endonuclease is proposed and tested by creating 
      six variants in which active-site residues are replaced with alanine. The side 
      chains of three residues (Arg61, His98, and Asn119) are found to be important for 
      efficient catalysis of DNA cleavage. This finding is consistent with the proposed 
      mechanism in which His98 abstracts a proton from an attacking water molecule bound 
      by an adjacent phosphoryl oxygen, Arg61 and Asn119 stabilize the pentavalent 
      transition state, and Asn119 also binds to the essential divalent metal cation 
      (e.g., Mg(2+) ion), which interacts with the 3'-oxygen leaving group. Because Mg(2+) 
      is required for cleavage of a substrate with a good leaving group 
      (p-nitrophenolate), Mg(2+) likely stabilizes the pentavalent transition state. The 
      pH-dependence of k(cat) for catalysis by I-PpoI reveals a macroscopic pK(a) of 8.4 
      for titratable groups that modulate product release. I-PpoI appears to be unique 
      among known restriction endonucleases and homing endonucleases in its use of a 
      histidine residue to activate the attacking water molecule for in-line displacement 
      of the 3'-leaving group.

AB  - Cells, including unicellulars, are highly sensitive to external constraints from 
      their environment. Amoeboid cells change their cell shape during locomotion and in 
      response to external stimuli. Physarum polycephalum is a large multinucleated 
      amoeboid cell that extends and develops pseudopods. In this paper, changes in cell 
      behavior and shape were measured during the exploration of homogenous and 
      non-homogenous environments that presented neutral, and nutritive and/or adverse 
      substances. In the first place, we developed a fully automated image analysis method 
      to measure quantitatively changes in both migration and shape. Then we measured 
      various metrics that describe the area covered, the exploration dynamics, the 
      migration rate and the slime mold shape. Our results show that: (1) Not only the 
      nature, but also the spatial distribution of chemical substances affect the 
      exploration behavior of slime molds; (2) Nutritive and adverse substances both slow 
      down the exploration and prevent the formation of pseudopods; and (3) Slime mold 
      placed in an adverse environment preferentially occupies previously explored areas 
      rather than unexplored areas using mucus secretion as a buffer. Our results also 
      show that slime molds migrate at a rate governed by the substrate up until they get 
      within a critical distance to chemical substances.

TI  - Amoebozoa possess lineage-specific globin gene repertoires gained by individual

AB  - The Amoebozoa represent a clade of unicellular amoeboid organisms that display a 
      wide variety of lifestyles, including free-living and parasitic species. For 
      example, the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum has the ability to aggregate 
      into a multicellular fruiting body upon starvation, while the pathogenic amoeba 
      Entamoeba histolytica is a parasite of humans. Globins are small heme proteins that 
      are present in almost all extant organisms. Although several genomes of amoebozoan 
      species have been sequenced, little is known about the phyletic distribution of 
      globin genes within this phylum. Only two flavohemoglobins (FHbs) of D. discoideum 
      have been reported and characterized previously while the genomes of Entamoeba 
      species are apparently devoid of globin genes. We investigated eleven amoebozoan 
      species for the presence of globin genes by genomic and phylogenetic in silico 
      analyses. Additional FHb genes were identified in the genomes of four social amoebas 
      and the true slime mold Physarum polycephalum. Moreover, a single-domain globin 
      (SDFgb) of Hartmannella vermiformis, as well as two truncated hemoglobins (trHbs) of 
      Acanthamoeba castellanii were identified. Phylogenetic evidence suggests that these 
      globin genes were independently acquired via horizontal gene transfer from some 
      ancestral bacteria. Furthermore, the phylogenetic tree of amoebozoan FHbs indicates 
      that they do not share a common ancestry and that a transfer of FHbs from bacteria 
      to amoeba occurred multiple times.

TI  - DNA binding and cleavage by the nuclear intron-encoded homing endonuclease I-PpoI.
PG  - 96-101
AB  - Homing endonucleases are a diverse collection of proteins that are encoded by genes 
      with mobile, self-splicing introns. They have also been identified in self-splicing 
      inteins (protein introns). These enzymes promote the movement of the DNA sequences 
      that encode them from one chromosome location to another; they do this by making a 
      site-specific double-strand break at a target site in an allele that lacks the 
      corresponding mobile intron. The target sites recognized by these small 
      endonucleases are generally long (14-44 base pairs). Four families of homing 
      endonucleases have been identified, including the LAGLIDADG, the His-Cys box, the 
      GIY-YIG and the H-N-H endonucleases. The first identified His-Cys box homing 
      endonuclease was I-PpoI from the slime mould Physarum polycephalum. Its gene resides 
      in one of only a few nuclear introns known to exhibit genetic mobility. Here we 
      report the structure of the I-PpoI homing endonuclease bound to homing-site DNA 
      determined to 1.8 A resolution. I-PpoI displays an elongated fold of dimensions 25 x 
      35 x 80 A, with mixed alpha/beta topology. Each I-PpoI monomer contains three 
      antiparallel beta-sheets flanked by two long alpha-helices and a long 
      carboxy-terminal tail, and is stabilized by two bound zinc ions 15 A apart. The 
      enzyme possesses a new zinc-bound fold and endonuclease active site. The structure 
      has been determined in both uncleaved substrate and cleaved product complexes.

TI  - Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 promotes recruitment of meiotic recombination-11 to

AB  - Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1 may act in an error-prone pathway called 
      alternative end joining (Alt-EJ) for DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair when 
      nonhomologous end joining is defective. We examined the recruitment of PARP-1 to 
      chromatin in response to radiomimetic agents and the effects of PARP-1 inhibition on 
      DSB repair and recruitment of the meiotic recombination (MRE)-11-double-strand break 
      repair (RAD50) protein-Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NSB)-1 (MRN) complex to the 
      chromatin in Ku70-deficient breast cancer cells. The chromatin-binding affinity of 
      PARP-1 was enhanced in response to neocarzinostatin (NCS) or calicheamicin treatment 
      in the absence of Ku70. PARP-1 inhibition impaired the repair of both NCS-induced 
      DSBs and intron-encoded endonuclease from Physarum polycephalum-induced 
      site-specific DSB. Both fractionation and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays 
      demonstrated that chromatin recruitment of MRN was PARP-1 dependent. These data 
      suggest that PARP-1 is vital for DSB repair in breast cancer cells when Alt-EJ is 
      activated.-Huang, Y., Shao, Q., Luo, X., Yang, D., Zeng, B., Xiang, T., Ren, G.,

TI  - Characterization of a nitric oxide synthase from the plant kingdom: NO generation 
      from the green alga Ostreococcus tauri is light irradiance and growth phase 
      dependent.
PG  - 3816-30
LID - 10.1105/tpc.109.073510 [doi]
AB  - The search for a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) sequence in the plant kingdom yielded 
      two sequences from the recently published genomes of two green algae species of the 
      Ostreococcus genus, O. tauri and O. lucimarinus. In this study, we characterized the 
      sequence, protein structure, phylogeny, biochemistry, and expression of NOS from O. 
      tauri. The amino acid sequence of O. tauri NOS was found to be 45% similar to that 
      of human NOS. Folding assignment methods showed that O. tauri NOS can fold as the 
      human endothelial NOS isoform. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that O. tauri NOS 
      clusters together with putative NOS sequences of a Synechoccocus sp strain and 
      Physarum polycephalum. This cluster appears as an outgroup of NOS representatives 
      from metazoa. Purified recombinant O. tauri NOS has a K(m) for the substrate l-Arg 
      of 12 ± 5 μM. Escherichia coli cells expressing recombinant O. tauri NOS have 
      increased levels of NO and cell viability. O. tauri cultures in the exponential 
      growth phase produce 3-fold more NOS-dependent NO than do those in the stationary 
      phase. In O. tauri, NO production increases in high intensity light irradiation and 
      upon addition of l-Arg, suggesting a link between NOS activity and microalgal 
      physiology.

TI  - Lens crystallins and their microbial homologs: structure, stability, and function.
PG  - 435-99
AB  - abg-Crystallins are the major protein components in the vertebrate eye lens--a as a 
      molecular chaperone and b and g as structural proteins. Surprisingly, the latter two 
      share some structural characteristics with a number of microbial stress proteins. 
      The common denominator is not only the Greek key topology of their polypeptide 
      chains but also their high intrinsic stability, which, in certain microbial 
      crystallin homologs, is further enhanced by high-affinity Ca2+-binding. Recent 
      studies of natural and mutant vertebrate bg-crystallins as well as spherulin 3a from 
      Physarum polycephalum and Protein S from Myxococcus xanthus allowed the correlation 
      of structure and stability of crystallins to be elucidated in some detail. From the 
      thermodynamic point of view, stability increments come from (1) local interactions 
      involved in the close packing of the cooperative units, (2) the all-b secondary 
      structure of the Greek-key motif, (3) intramolecular interactions between domains, 
      (4) intermolecular domain interactions, including 3D domain swapping and (v) 
      excluded volume effects due to "molecular crowding" at the high cellular protein 
      concentrations. Apart from these contributions to the Gibbs free energy of 
      stability, significant kinetic stabilization originates from the high activation 
      energy barrier determining the rate of unfolding from the native to the unfolded 
      state. From the functional point of view, the high stability is responsible for the 
      long-term transparency of the eye lens, on the one hand, and the stress resistance 
      of the microorganisms in their dormant state on the other. Local structural 
      perturbations due to chemical modification, wrong protein interactions, or other 
      irreversible processes may lead to protein aggregation. A leading cataract 
      hypothesis is that only after a-crystallin, a member of the small heat-shock protein 
      family, is titrated out does pathological opacity occur. Understanding the 
      structural basis of protein stability in the healthy eye lens is the route to solve 
      the enormous medical and economical problem of cataract.

TI  - Microtubule organization by cross-linking and bundling proteins.
PG  - 145-55
AB  - To understand microtubule function the factors regulating their spatial organization 
      and their interaction with cellular organelles, including other microtubules, must 
      be elucidated. Many proteins are implicated in these organizational events and the 
      known consequences of their actions within the cell are increasing. For example, the 
      function of microtubule bundles at the surfaces of polarized cells has recently 
      received attention, as has the action in cortical rotation of a transient 
      arrangement of microtubules found beneath the vegetal surface of fertilized frog 
      eggs. The in vivo association of microtubules during early Xenopus oogenesis has 
      added interest as microtubules bundled in cell-free extracts are protected against 
      the action of a severing protein found in this animal. A 52 kDa F-actin bundling 
      protein purified from Physarum polycephalum organizes microtubules and causes the 
      cobundling of microtubules and microfilaments. These observations, in concert with 
      others that are presented, emphasize the diversity within the family of microtubule 
      cross-linking proteins. The challenge is to determine which proteins are relevant 
      from a physiological perspective, to ascertain their molecular mechanisms of action 
      and to describe how they affect cytoplasmic organization and cell function. To 
      realize this objective, the proteins which cross-link and bundle microtubules must 
      be investigated by techniques which reveal different but related aspects of their 
      properties. Cloning and sequencing of genes for cross-linking proteins, their 
      subcellular localization especially as microtubule-related changes in cell 
      morphology are occurring and the application of genetic studies are necessary. Study 
      of the neural MAP provides the best example of just how powerful current 
      experimental approaches are and at the same time shows their limits. The neural MAP 
      have long been noted for their enhancement of tubulin assembly and microtubule 
      stability. Their spatial distribution has been studied during the morphogenesis of 
      neural cells. Sequencing of cloned genes has revealed the functional domains of 
      neural MAP including carboxy-terminal microtubule-binding sites. Similarities to 
      microtubule binding proteins from other cell types stimulate interest in the neural 
      MAP and further suggest their importance in microtubule organization. For example, 
      MAP4 enjoys a wide cellular distribution and has microtubule-binding sequences very 
      similar to those in the neural MAP. Moreover, the nontubulin proteins of marginal 
      bands are immunologically related to neural MAP, indicating shared 
      structural/functional domains. Even with these findings the mechanism by which 
      neural MAP cross-link microtubules remains uncertain. Indeed, some researchers 
      express doubt that microtubule cross-linking is actually a function of neural MAP in 
      vivo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

TI  - Homologies between members of the germin gene family in hexaploid wheat and 
      similarities between these wheat germins and certain Physarum spherulins.
PG  - 10461-9
AB  - By screening approximately 10(6) plaques in a wheat DNA library with a "full-length" 
      germin cDNA probe, two genomic clones were detected. When digested with EcoRI, one 
      clone yielded a 2.8-kilobase pair fragment (gf-2.8) and the other yielded a 
      3.8-kilobase pair fragment (gf-3.8). By nucleotide sequencing, each of gf-2.8 and 
      gf-3.8 was found to encode a complete sequence for germin and germin mRNA, and to 
      contain appreciable amounts of 5'- and 3'-flanking sequences. The "cap" site in 
      gf-2.8 was determined by primer extension and the corresponding site in gf-3.8 was 
      deduced by analogy. The mRNA coding sequences in gf-2.8 and gf-3.8 are intronless 
      and 87% homologous with one another. The 5'-flanking regions in gf-2.8 and gf-3.8 
      contain recognizable sites of what are probably cis-acting elements but there is 
      otherwise little if any significant similarity between them. In addition to putative 
      TATA and CAAT boxes in the 5'-flanking regions of gf-2.8 and gf-3.8, there are 
      AT-rich inverted-repeats, GC boxes, long purine-rich sequences, two 19-base pair 
      direct-repeat sequences in gf-2.8, and a remarkably long (200-base pair) 
      inverted-repeat sequence (approximately 90% homology) in gf-3.8. An 8% difference 
      between the mature-protein coding regions in gf-2.8 and gf-3.8 is reflected by a 
      corresponding 7% difference between the corresponding 201-residue proteins. Most 
      significantly, the same 8% difference between the mature-protein coding regions in 
      gf-2.8 and gf-3.8 is allied with no change whatever in a central part (61-151) of 
      the encoded polypeptide sequences. It seems likely that this central, strongly 
      conserved core in the germins is of first importance in the biochemical involvements 
      of the proteins. When an equivalence is assumed between like amino acids, the gf-2.8 
      and gf-3.8 germins show significant (approximately 44%) similarity to spherulins 1a 
      and 1b of Physarum polycephalum, a similarity that increases to approximately 50% in 
      the conserved core of germin. Near the middle (87-96) of the conserved core in the 
      germins is a rare PH(I/T)HPRATEI decapeptide sequence which is shared by spherulins 
      (1a and 1b) and germins (gf-2.8 and gf-3.8). These similarities are discussed in the 
      context of evidence which can be interpreted to suggest that the biochemistry of 
      germins and spherulins is involved with cellular, perhaps cell-wall responses to 
      desiccation, hydration, and osmotic stress.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

      control region (HCR), was critical for activation under hypha-inducing conditions 
      and conferred developmental regulation to a heterologous ENO1 promoter. A more 
      distal region of the promoter served to amplify the level of promoter activation. 
      Using gel mobility shift assays, a 249-bp subregion of HCR, HCRa, was found to bind 
      at least four proteins from crude extracts of yeasts and hyphae with differing 
      binding patterns dependent on cell morphology. Four proteins with DNA binding 
      activities were identified by using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel 
      electrophoresis after separation by anion-exchange and heparin-Sepharose 
      chromatography. One protein with high similarity to Nhp6, an HMG1 family member in 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and another with weak similarity to an HMG-like 
      condensation factor from Physarum polycephalum implicated changes in chromatin 
      structure as a critical process in hypha-specific gene regulation. Proteins with 
      strong homology to histones were also found. These studies are the first to identify 
      proteins that bind to a DNA segment that confers developmental gene regulation in C. 
      albicans and suggest a new model for hypha-specific gene regulation.

TI  - Inhibition of tumor invasion and metastasis by a novel lysophosphatidic acid (cyclic 
      LPA).
PG  - 918-22
AB  - Fetal calf serum (FCS) and 1-oleoyl lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) were previously 
      found to be potent inducers of invasion (transcellular migration) in an in vitro 
      system. A novel LPA, composed of cyclic phosphate and cyclopropane-containing 
      hexadecanoic acid (PHYLPA), first isolated from myxoamoebae of Physarum 
      polycephalum, and its synthetic derivatives (cLPA) were tested for their ability to 
      inhibit tumor cell invasion and metastasis. Amoung these, Pal-cLPA, which has a 
      palmitoyl moiety, was most potent in inhibiting invasion, with 93.8% inhibition at 
      the concentration of 25 microM. Invasion in vitro by mouse melanoma cells (B16), 
      human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells (PSN-1), human lung cancer cells (OC-10) and 
      human fibrosarcoma cells (HT-1080) was also inhibited by Pal-cLPA. The stimulation 
      of MMI cells with LPA triggered F-actin formation, which was impaired by the 
      addition of Pal-cLPA at invasion-inhibitory concentration. Pal-cLPA induced a rapid 
      increase in adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) concentration in MMI cells. 
      The addition of dibutyryl cAMP significantly abrogated LPA-induced invasion by MM1 
      cells and actin polymerization in the cells. The inhibition of MM1 cell invasion by 
      Pal-cLPA may be ascribed to an increased level of cAMP. Pal-cLPA also suppressed 
      invasion in vitro by MM1 cells induced by FCS dose dependently, without affecting 
      proliferation. It also suppressed the pulmonary metastasis of B16 mouse melanoma 
      cells injected into the tail vein of C57BL/6 mice. Thus, Pal-cLPA is effective in 
      inhibiting invasion and metastasis of a variety of tumor cells.

TI  - Protists as catalyzers of microbial litter breakdown and carbon cycling at different 
      temperature regimes.

AB  - Soil bacteria and fungi are key drivers of carbon released from soils to the 
      atmosphere through decomposition of plant-derived organic carbon sources. This 
      process has important consequences for the global climate. While global change 
      factors, such as increased temperature, are known to affect bacterial- and 
      fungal-mediated decomposition rates, the role of trophic interactions in affecting 
      decomposition remains largely unknown. We designed synthetic microbial communities 
      consisting of eight bacterial and eight fungal species and tested the influence of 
      predation by a model protist, Physarum polycephalum, on litter breakdown at 17 and 
      21 °C. Protists increased CO(2) release and litter mass loss by ~35% at 17 °C lower 
      temperatures, while they only had minor effects on microbial-driven CO(2) release 
      and mass loss at 21 °C. We found species-specific differences in predator-prey 
      interactions, which may affect microbial community composition and functioning and 
      thus underlie the impact of protists on litter breakdown. Our findings suggest that 
      microbial predation by fast-growing protists is of under-appreciated functional 
      importance, as it affects decomposition and, as such, may influence global carbon 
      dynamics. Our results indicate that we need to better understand the role of trophic 
      interactions within the microbiome in controlling decomposition processes and carbon 
      cycling.

      for multitargeting drug delivery.
PG  - 247-65
LID - 10.2217/17435889.3.2.247 [doi]
AB  - Nanoconjugates are emerging as promising drug-delivery vehicles because of their 
      multimodular structure enabling them to actively target discrete cells, pass through 
      biological barriers and simultaneously carry multiple drugs of various chemical 
      nature. Nanoconjugates have matured from simple devices to multifunctional, 
      biodegradable, nontoxic and nonimmunogenic constructs, capable of delivering 
      synergistically functioning drugs in vivo. This review mainly concerns the Polycefin 
      family of natural-derived polymeric drug-delivery devices as an example. This type 
      of vehicle is built by hierarchic conjugation of functional groups onto the backbone 
      of poly(malic acid), an aliphatic polyester obtained from the microorganism Physarum 
      polycephalum. Particular Polycefin variants target human brain and breast tumors 
      implanted into animals specifically and actively and could be detected easily by 
      noninvasive imaging analysis. Delivery of antisense oligonucleotides to a 
      tumor-specific angiogenic marker using Polycefin resulted in significant inhibition 
      of tumor angiogenesis and increase of animal survival.

TI  - Inhibition of laminin-8 in vivo using a novel poly(malic acid)-based carrier reduces 
      glioma angiogenesis.
PG  - 183-91
AB  - We have previously shown that laminin-8, a vascular basement membrane component, was 
      overexpressed in human glioblastomas multiforme and their adjacent tissues compared 
      to normal brain. Increased laminin-8 correlated with shorter glioblastoma recurrence 
      time and poor patient survival making it a potential marker for glioblastoma 
      diagnostics and prediction of disease outcome. However, laminin-8 therapeutic 
      potential was unknown because the technology of blocking the expression of 
      multi-chain complex proteins was not yet developed. To inhibit the expression of 
      laminin-8 constituents in glioblastoma in vitro and in vivo, we used Polycefin, a 
      bioconjugate drug delivery system based on slime-mold Physarum polycephalum-derived 
      poly(malic acid). It carries an attached transferrin receptor antibody to target 
      tumor cells and to deliver two conjugated morpholino antisense oligonucleotides 
      against laminin-8 alpha4 and beta1 chains. Polycefin efficiently inhibited the 
      expression of both laminin-8 chains by cultured glioblastoma cells. Intracranial 
      Polycefin treatment of human U87MG glioblastoma-bearing nude rats reduced 
      incorporation of both tumor-derived laminin-8 chains into vascular basement 
      membranes. Polycefin was thus able to simultaneously inhibit the expression of two 
      different chains of a complex protein. The treatment also significantly reduced 
      tumor microvessel density (p < 0.001) and area (p < 0.001) and increased animal 
      survival (p < 0.0004). These data suggest that laminin-8 may be important for 
      glioblastoma angiogenesis. Polycefin, a versatile nanoscale drug delivery system, 
      was suitable for in vivo delivery of two antisense oligonucleotides to brain tumor 
      cells causing a reduction of glioblastoma angiogenesis and an increase of animal 
      survival. This system may hold promise for future clinical applications.

TI  - Nanoconjugate based on polymalic acid for tumor targeting.
PG  - 195-203
AB  - A new prototype of polymer-derived drug delivery system, the nanoconjugate 
      Polycefin, was tested for its ability to accumulate in tumors based on enhanced 
      permeability and retention (EPR) effect and receptor mediated endocytosis. Polycefin 
      was synthesized for targeted delivery of Morpholino antisense oligonucleotides into 
      certain tumors. It consists of units that are covalently conjugated with 
      poly(beta-l-malic acid) (M(w) 50,000, M(w)/M(n) 1.3) highly purified from cultures 
      of myxomycete Physarum polycephalum. The units are active in endosomal uptake, 
      disruption of endosomal membranes, oligonucleotide release in the cytoplasm, and 
      protection against enzymatic degradation in the vascular system. The polymer is 
      biodegradable, non-immunogenic and non-toxic. Polycefin was also coupled with 
      AlexaFluor 680 C2-maleimide dye for in vivo detection. Nude mice received 
      subcutaneous injections of MDA-MB 468 human breast cancer cells into the left 
      posterior mid-dorsum or intracranial injections of human glioma cell line U87MG. 
      Polycefin at concentration of 2.5mg/kg was injected via the tail vein. In vivo 
      fluorescence tumor imaging was performed at different time points, 0-180 min up to 
      24h after the drug injection. The custom-made macro-illumination imaging MISTI 
      system was used to examine the in vivo drug accumulation in animals bearing human 
      breast and brain tumors. In breast tumors the fluorescence signal in large blood 
      vessels and in the tumor increased rapidly until 60 min and remained in the tumor at 
      a level 6 times higher than in non-tumor tissue (180 min) (p<0.003). In brain tumors

PG  - 153-162
LID - 10.1007/s10974-019-09571-5 [doi]
AB  - Gelsolin superfamily proteins, consisting of multiple domains (usually six), sever 
      actin filaments and cap the barbed ends in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. Two types of 
      evolutionally conserved Ca(2+)-binding sites have been identified in this family; 
      type-1 (between gelsolin and actin) and type-2 (within the gelsolin domain). 
      Fragmin, a member in the slime mold Physarum polycephalum, consists of three domains 
      (F1-F3) that are highly similar to the N-terminal half of mammalian gelsolin 
      (G1-G3). Despite their similarities, the two proteins exhibit a significant 
      difference in the Ca(2+) dependency; F1-F3 absolutely requires Ca(2+) for the 
      filament severing whereas G1-G3 does not. In this study, we examined the strong 
      dependency of fragmin on Ca(2+) using biochemical and structural approaches. Our 
      co-sedimentation assay demonstrated that Ca(2+) significantly enhanced the binding 
      of F2-F3 to actin. We determined the crystal structure of F2-F3 in the presence of 
      Ca(2+). F2-F3 binds a total of three calcium ions; while two are located in type-2 
      sites within F2 or F3, the remaining one resides between the F2 long helix and the 
      F3 short helix. The inter-domain Ca(2+)-coordination appears to stabilize F2-F3 in a 
      closely packed configuration. Notably, the F3 long helix exhibits a bent 
      conformation which is different from the straight G3 long helix in the presence of 
      Ca(2+). Our results provide the first structural evidence for the existence of an 
      unconventional Ca(2+)-binding site in the gelsolin superfamily proteins.

AB  - Isolated nuclei ofPhysarum contain endogenous RNA polymerase activity. We provide 
      evidence for four different states of RNA polymerase B: 1. free enzyme (85%); 2. 
      weakly bound enzyme (10%) and 3. tightly bound enzyme (0-4%), which can be 
      solubilized from isolated nuclei with 0.5 M and 1.5 M NaCl respectively; 4. 
      "initiated" enzyme. The latter fraction (1-5% of the total RNA polymerase B) is not 
      soluble in salt extractions, does not accept external templates, shows high salt 
      optimum for transcription (0.4 M NaCl) and produces by elongation RNA molecules of 
      mainly 10 S. Treatment of isolated nuclei from differentiating cultures with Triton 
      X-100 increases the proportion of the "initiated" enzyme at the expense of the 
      tightly bound enzyme fraction. This indicates a potential transcription control 
      mechanism which operates at the chromatin level and results in variable proportions 
      of silent and transcribing RNA polymerase B molecules during differentiation of 
      Physarum.

TI  - Structure, function and evolution of the mitochondrial division apparatus.
PG  - 510-21
AB  - Mitochondria are derived from free-living alpha-proteobacteria that were engulfed by 
      eukaryotic host cells through the process of endosymbiosis, and therefore have their 
      own DNA which is organized using basic proteins to form organelle nuclei 
      (nucleoids). Mitochondria divide and are split amongst the daughter cells during 
      cell proliferation. Their division can be separated into two main events: division 
      of the mitochondrial nuclei and division of the matrix (the so-called mitochondrial 
      division, or mitochondriokinesis). In this review, we first focus on the 
      cytogenetical relationships between mitochondrial nuclear division and 
      mitochondriokinesis. Mitochondriokinesis occurs after mitochondrial nuclear 
      division, similar to bacterial cytokinesis. We then describe the fine structure and 
      dynamics of the mitochondrial division ring (MD ring) as a basic morphological 
      background for mitochondriokinesis. Electron microscopy studies first identified a 
      small electron-dense MD ring in the cytoplasm at the constriction sites of dividing 
      mitochondria in the slime mold Physarum polycephalum, and then two large MD rings 
      (with outer cytoplasmic and inner matrix sides) in the red alga Cyanidioschyzon 
      merolae. Now MD rings have been found in all eukaryotes. In the third section, we 
      describe the relationships between the MD ring and the FtsZ ring descended from 
      ancestral bacteria. Other than the GTPase, FtsZ, mitochondria have lost most of the 
      proteins required for bacterial cytokinesis as a consequence of endosymbiosis. The 
      FtsZ protein forms an electron transparent ring (FtsZ or Z ring) in the matrix 
      inside the inner MD ring. For the fourth section, we describe the dynamic 
      association between the outer MD ring with a ring composed of the eukaryote-specific 
      GTPase dynamin. Recent studies have revealed that eukaryote-specific GTPase dynamins 
      form an electron transparent ring between the outer membrane and the MD ring. Thus, 
      mitochondriokinesis is thought to be controlled by a mitochondrial division (MD) 
      apparatus including a dynamic trio, namely the FtsZ, MD and dynamin rings, which 
      consist of a chimera of rings from bacteria and eukaryotes in primitive organisms. 
      Since the genes for the MD ring and dynamin rings are not found in the prokaryotic 
      genome, the host genomes may make these rings to actively control mitochondrial 
      division. In the fifth part, we focus on the dynamic changes in the formation and 
      disassembly of the FtsZ, MD and dynamin rings. FtsZ rings are digested during a 
      later period of mitochondrial division and then finally the MD and dynamin ring 
      apparatuses pinched off the daughter mitochondria, supporting the idea that the host 
      genomes are responsible for the ultimate control of mitochondrial division. We 
      discuss the evolution, from the original vesicle division (VD) apparatuses to VD 
      apparatuses including classical dynamin rings and MD apparatuses. It is likely that 
      the MD apparatuses involving the dynamic trio evolved into the plastid division (PD) 
      apparatus in Bikonta, while in Opisthokonta, the MD apparatus was simplified during 
      evolution and may have branched into the mitochondrial fusion apparatus. Finally, we 
      describe the possibility of intact isolation of large MD/PD apparatuses, the 
      identification of all their proteins and their related genes using C. merolae genome 
      information and TOF-MS analyses. These results will assist in elucidating the 
      universal mechanism and evolution of MD, PD and VD apparatuses.

      developmental competence acquisition in two non-mammalian vertebrates.
PG  - 18
LID - 10.1186/1471-2164-11-18 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In vertebrates, late oogenesis is a key period during which the oocyte 
      acquires its ability to resume meiosis (i.e. maturational competence) and to 
      develop, once fertilized, into a normal embryo (i.e. developmental competence). 
      However, the molecular mechanisms involved in these key biological processes are far 
      from being fully understood. In order to identify key mechanisms conserved among 
      teleosts and amphibians, we performed a comparative analysis using ovarian tissue 
      sampled at successive steps of the maturational competence acquisition process in 
      the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and in the clawed toad (Xenopus laevis). Our 
      study aimed at identifying common differentially expressed genes during late 
      oogenesis in both species. Using an existing transcriptomic analysis that had 
      previously been carried out in rainbow trout, candidate genes were selected for 
      subsequent quantitative PCR-based comparative analysis. RESULTS: Among the 1200 
      differentially expressed clones in rainbow trout, twenty-six candidate genes were 
      selected for further analysis by real-time PCR in both species during late 
      oogenesis. Among these genes, eight had similar expression profiles in trout and 
      Xenopus. Six genes were down-regulated during oocyte maturation (cyp19a1, cyp17a1, 
      tescalcin, tfr1, cmah, hsd11b3) while two genes exhibited an opposite pattern 
      (apoc1, star). In order to document possibly conserved molecular mechanisms, four 
      genes (star, cyp19a1, cyp17a1 and hsd11b3) were further studied due to their known 
      or suspected role in steroidogenesis after characterization of the orthology 
      relationships between rainbow trout and Xenopus genes. Apoc1 was also selected for 
      further analysis because of its reported function in cholesterol transport, which 
      may modulate steroidogenesis by regulating cholesterol bioavailability in the 
      steroidogenic cells. CONCLUSIONS: We have successfully identified orthologous genes 
      exhibiting conserved expression profiles in the ovarian follicle during late 
      oogenesis in both trout and Xenopus. While some identified genes were previously 
      uncharacterized during Xenopus late oogenesis, the nature of these genes has pointed 
      out molecular mechanisms possibly conserved in amphibians and teleosts. It should 
      also be stressed that in addition to the already suspected importance of 
      steroidogenesis in maturational competence acquisition, our approach has shed light 
      on other regulatory pathways which may be involved in maturational and developmental 
      competence acquisitions that will require further studies.
