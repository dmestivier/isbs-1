AB  - Recent results show that the chemotactic response of uni-cellular decentralized 
      systems such as amoeboid and mammalian cells, is excitable. The same observation has 
      not yet been reported for multi-nucleated decentralized biological systems. Here we 
      present experimental results that shows the Physarum polycephalum plasmodial nodes 
      spatio-temporal chemotactic dynamics as an excitable response. We found a highly 
      optimized signal synthesis method wherein the Physarum nodes employ two intensity 
      thresholds to properly navigate the chemoattractant field and generate corresponding 
      spike dynamics in the node count. The node spike dynamics was found to correspond to 
      the polarized-depolarized transition in the Physarum polycephalum morphology. 
      Validation of our experimental observations via Brownian lattice simulations yields 
      the same quantitative results with our experiments.

AB  - Concerns about the environmental and human health implications of TiO(2) 
      nanoparticles (nTiO(2)) are growing with their increased use in consumer and 
      industrial products. Investigations of the underlying molecular mechanisms of 
      nTiO(2) tolerance in organisms will assist in countering nTiO(2) toxicity. In this 
      study, the countermeasures exhibited by the slime mold Physarum polycephalum 
      macroplasmodium against nTiO(2) toxicity were investigated from a physiological, 
      transcriptional, and metabolic perspective. The results suggested that the 
      countermeasures against nTiO(2) exposure include gene-associated metabolic 
      rearrangements in cellular pathways involved in amino acid, carbohydrate, and 
      nucleic acid metabolism. Gene-associated nonmetabolic rearrangements involve 
      processes such as DNA repair, DNA replication, and the cell cycle, and occur mainly 
      when macroplasmodia are exposed to inhibitory doses of nTiO(2). Interestingly, the 
      growth of macroplasmodia and mammal cells was significantly restored by 
      supplementation with a combination of responsive metabolites identified by 
      metabolome analysis. Taken together, we report a novel model organism for the study 
      of nTiO(2) tolerance and provide insights into countermeasures taken by 
      macroplasmodia in response to nTiO(2) toxicity. Furthermore, we also present an 
      approach to mitigate the effects of nTiO(2) toxicity in cells by metabolic 
      intervention.

AB  - Microbial fuels cells (MFCs) are bio-electrochemical transducers that generate 
      energy from the metabolism of electro-active microorganisms. The organism Physarum 
      polycephalum is a slime mould, which has demonstrated many novel and interesting 
      properties in the field of unconventional computation, such as route mapping between 
      nutrient sources, maze solving and nutrient balancing. It is a motile, 
      photosensitive and oxygen-consuming organism, and is known to be symbiotic with 
      some, and antagonistic with other microbial species. In the context of artificial 
      life, the slime mould would provide a biological mechanism (along with the microbial 
      community) for controlling the performance and behaviour of artificial systems 
      (MFCs, robots). In the experiments it was found that P. polycephalum did not 
      generate significant amounts of power when inoculated in the anode. However, when P. 
      polycephalum was introduced in the cathode of MFCs, a statistically significant 
      difference in power output was observed.

AB  - This research addresses the interactions between the unicellular slime mold Physarum 
      polycephalum and a red yeast in a spatial ecosystem over week-long imaging 
      experiments. An inverse relationship between the growth rates of both species is 
      shown, where P. polycephalum has positive growth when the red yeast has a negative 
      growth rate and vice versa. The data also captures successional and oscillatory 
      dynamics between both species. An advanced image analysis methodology for semantic 
      segmentation is used to quantify population density over time, for all components of 
      the ecosystem. We suggest that P. polycephalum is capable of exhibiting a 
      sustainable feeding strategy by depositing a nutritive slime trail, allowing yeast 
      to serve as a periodic food source. This opens a new direction of P. polycephalum 
      research, where the population dynamics of spatial ecosystems can be readily 
      quantified and complex ecological dynamics can be studied.

AB  - Because of its peculiar biology and the ease with which it can be cultured, the 
      acellular slime mould Physarum polycephalum has long been a model organism in a 
      range of disciplines. Due to its macroscopic, syncytial nature, it is no surprise 
      that it has been a favourite amongst cell biologists. Its inclusion in the 
      experimental tool kit of behavioural ecologists is much more recent. These recent 
      studies have certainly paid off. They have shown that, for an organism that lacks a 
      brain or central nervous system, P. polycephalum shows rather complex behaviour. For 
      example, it is capable of finding the shortest path through a maze, it can construct 
      networks as efficient as those designed by humans, it can solve computationally 
      difficult puzzles, it makes multi-objective foraging decisions, it balances its 
      nutrient intake and it even behaves irrationally. Are the slime mould's achievements 
      simply "cute", worthy of mentioning in passing but nothing to take too seriously? Or 
      do they hint at the fundamental processes underlying all decision making? We will 
      address this question after reviewing the decision-making abilities of the slime 
      mould.

TI  - Calcium regulation of the actin-myosin interaction of Physarum polycephalum.
PG  - 53-98
AB  - Plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum show vigorous cytoplasmic streaming, the motive 
      force of which is supported by the actin-myosin interaction. Calcium is not required 
      for the interaction but inhibits it. This calcium inhibition, a regulatory mode 
      first discovered in Physarum, is the overwhelming mode of regulation of cytoplasmic 
      streaming of plant cells and lower eukaryotes, and it is diametrically opposite to 
      calcium activation of the interaction found in muscle and nonmuscle cells of the 
      animal kingdom. Myosin, myosin II in myosin superfamily, is the most important 
      protein for Ca2+ action. Its essential light chain, called calcium-binding light 
      chain, is the sole protein that binds Ca2+. Although phosphorylation and 
      dephosphorylation of myosin modify its properties, regulation of physiological 
      significance is shown to be Ca-binding to myosin. The actin-binding protein of 
      Physarum amplifies calcium inhibition when Ca2+ binds to calmodulin and other 
      calcium-binding proteins. This review also includes characterization of this and 
      other calcium-binding proteins of Physarum.

AB  - Complex behaviors are typically associated with animals, but the capacity to 
      integrate information and function as a coordinated individual is also a ubiquitous 
      but poorly understood feature of organisms such as slime molds and fungi. Plasmodial 
      slime molds grow as networks and use flexible, undifferentiated body plans to forage 
      for food. How an individual communicates across its network remains a puzzle, but 
      Physarum polycephalum has emerged as a novel model used to explore emergent 
      dynamics. Within P. polycephalum, cytoplasm is shuttled in a peristaltic wave driven 
      by cross-sectional contractions of tubes. We first track P. polycephalum's response 
      to a localized nutrient stimulus and observe a front of increased contraction. The 
      front propagates with a velocity comparable to the flow-driven dispersion of 
      particles. We build a mathematical model based on these data and in the aggregate 
      experiments and model identify the mechanism of signal propagation across a body: 
      The nutrient stimulus triggers the release of a signaling molecule. The molecule is 
      advected by fluid flows but simultaneously hijacks flow generation by causing local 
      increases in contraction amplitude as it travels. The molecule is initiating a 
      feedback loop to enable its own movement. This mechanism explains previously 
      puzzling phenomena, including the adaptation of the peristaltic wave to organism 
      size and P. polycephalum's ability to find the shortest route between food sources. 
      A simple feedback seems to give rise to P. polycephalum's complex behaviors, and the 
      same mechanism is likely to function in the thousands of additional species with 
      similar behaviors.
